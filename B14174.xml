            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Gnorant altogether I am not of the disposition, though not much acquainted with the practises of this present age: wherein, to haue meditated vpon so many seuerall matters as I heere present vnto thy Christian view, will vnto some (I know) seeme but an effect of melancholie, as to haue taken the paines to pen them, will argue my want of other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, or forlorne hopes of worldly thriuing. Vnto others (and those more to be regarded) so soone in print to publish what had beene not so well concocted, and more rawly penned, will be censured as a spice of that vanitie which vsually haunts smatterers in good learning, but wherewith iudicious Clearks are seldome infected. To the former, I only wish mindes more setled, or lesse conscience of their owne extrauagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and carelesse mispence of choicest time, faults apt to breed a mislike of others industrie in such courses as will approue themselues in his sight that sits as Iudge and trier of all our waies, howsoeuer such as desire to be meere by-standers as well in Church as Common-wealthes affaires, may vpon sinister respects, mutually misinforme themselues. For many of the later, I am afraid, least, being partly such and so esteemed, they prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously affect not to be takē for more iudicious scholers then indeed they are: for the fostering of which conceit in others, their vnwillingnesse to publish what they haue conceiued aright, may well be apprehended as a meanes not improbable. Not to expose their meditations to publike censure, is and hath beene (as the Christian world too well can witnesse) a resolution incident to men of greatest iudgement: though no such es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall propertie, as necessarily argues, eyther all so minded to be, or all otherwise minded, not to be, alike iudicious. Certaine it is, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent the internall feature of mens minds is, the greater disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them will an ordinarie representation of it bee, and to adorne their choice conceits with such outward attire as best beseemes them,
<pb facs="tcp:7863:4"/> would require too great costes and charges. Thus from perfection oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times springs defect: whilest iudgement, too much ouergrowing fancie, and drying vp that kinde affection, whereby the fruit and vertue of one soule is diffused vnto another, makes men more iealous of diminishing the high estimate of their foreprized worth, then zealous of their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours good, which many times might be reaped in greatest abundance from such labours as yeeld least contentment to their Authors. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect alone can I gratulate my imperfections: hoping that as my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can neither please the delicate, for their forme, nor informe the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious for their matter: so they may proue neither offensiue for the one, nor vnfruitfull for the other, vnto many of a middle and inseriour ranke.</p>
                  <p>At the least (I trust) they will occasion some others, whom God hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with better abilitie and opportunitie, to hunt that out which in this long range I may chance to start, or make full conquest of that goodly field wherein that inestimable pearle lies hid, for whose discouerie these my trauels may happily yeeld some obseruations not impertinent. To this end haue I purposely trained my wits to vntroden pathes, to aduenture on new passages, vnto that true treasure which all of vs trafficke for, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one to anothers hindrance, the more because wee beate one place too much, when as many others might affoord vs the same or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commodities better cheape. Though the truth be one: yet it is not alwaies of one shape, whiles we looke vpon it diuers waies. The mine wherein it lies, is inexhaustible; oft times more full of drosse and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge, where most haue digged: and, though the inward substance of it be the same, yet the refining of it admits varietie of inuentions. Doe not preiudice me (charitable Reader) so much as in thy secret censure, as if these premises might seeme to argue my dissent in any conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which our Church professeth: the euent (I trust) shall acquit mee, and condemne all my accusers, if any I haue; and how I stand affected in points of spirituall obedience to my superiours, thou mayest be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if it please thee but to peruse some few sheetes of these my first fruites, which I presume thou wilt, surely thou oughtest, ere thy censure passe vpon me. If in the explication of some points I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accord not with some well esteemed domesticke writers: I trust <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> free borne children may enioy that priuiledge amongst themselues, which is permitted the sonnes of <hi>Hagar,</hi> in respect of their brethren, though all absolute bondmen to their mother. Yet that I doe not thus
<pb facs="tcp:7863:4"/> farre dissent from any of my mothers children, vpon emulation or humour of contradiction, thou wilt rest satisfied vpon my sincere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious protestation, That the whole fabricke of this intended worke was set, and euery maine conclusion resolued vpon, before I read any English writer vpon the arguments which I handle. From some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which had written before me, I haue since perceiued a direct dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in one or two points of moment; but wherein they had (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) contradicted the most iudicious writers of our Church and all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie I am acquainted with, more rashly, then I would doe the meanest this day liuing. Yet shall they, or whosoeuer of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, finde the manner of my disputing with them, such as shall not (I trust) exasperate, howsoeuer the dissonance of matter may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like them. For outlandish or forraine Latine writers, I must inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously confesse, when I first laboured to bee instructed in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall principles of faith and manners, some points which I much wished, I found they had not handled, in others, wherein I misliked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as vnsound, I could not alwaies finde that full satisfaction, which (me thought) a more accurate Artist (for a meane one I was then my selfe) would require. The greater since hath beene my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire eyther of giuing, or by my attempt, of procuring satisfaction. But will not others, when I haue done my best, so thinke and say of mine, as I haue done of these much better indeauours? It were great arrogance to expect any lesse. Notwithstanding, if what they shall finde defectiue in my labours, moue them to no worse patience, then what I thought (at least) was so in theirs that euery way goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mee, hath done mee: nor I, nor they, nor the Church of Christ, (by this meanes paitaker, and free to dislike or approue of both our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) shall (I trust) haue any great cause to repent vs of our paines. For thy better satisfaction, I will acquaint thee with the particulars which moued mee to write.</p>
                  <p>First, in vnfolding the nature and properties of Christian faith, to omit the errours of the Romish church, (wherein it is impossible it should euer come to full grouth,) many in reformed, too much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in particular Sermons, did striue to ripen it too fast. I haue heard complaints immediately from the mouthes of some yet liuing, of others deceased, that they had beene set too farre in their first Lessons: that the hopes they had out of hand directly built vpon GODS generall promises applied to them by their instructours,
<pb facs="tcp:7863:5"/> were too waightie, vnlesse the foundations of their faith had first beene more deepely and surely planted. That certainty of iustification and full perswasion of inherent sanctifying grace, whereat these worthies (whose footsteps I precisely tracke not) ayme, is (I protest) the marke which I propose vnto my selfe, but cannot hope at the first shoote to hit; if at the second, third, or fourth (as shall please God,) it must content me. In the meane time (I hope) I shall neither offend him, nor any of his, as long as I gather ground of what I prosecute, and still come nearer &amp; nearer the proposed end. The first step, me thought, that tended most directly to this certaine apprehension of sauing faith, was our vndoubted assent vnto the diuine truth of Scriptures in generall: and for the working of this assurance, meanes subordinate I could conceiue none better for the kinde (particulars others happily may finde more forcible,) then such as I haue prosecuted at large in the first booke: not ignorant, that such as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me more, might moue others lesse, those euery man most, that were of his owne gathering, wherein the disposition of the diuine prouidence (alwaies concurrent to this search, so men would marke it) is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. For this purpose I haue proposed such varietie of obseruations, as almost euery one able to read the Scriptures or other authors, of what sort or profession soeuer, students especially, may bee occasioned to make the like themselues, well hoping to finde a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thode as facile and easie for establishing the assent of the simple, and altogether illiterate, vnto those articles, whose distinct explicit knowledge is most necessary to saluation. But many (I know) will deeme the broken traditions, or imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of heathen men (for these I vse,) but weake supporters for so great an edifice: nor did I intend them for such seruice. Their ignorance notwithstanding, and darkned minds, doe much commend the light of diuine truth so may the experience of their vanitie dispose our minds to embrace the stabilitie of Gods word with greater stedfastnesse. We know the vertue and benefit of the Sunne, not so much by looking vpon it selfe continually or directly, as by the varietie of other obiects or colours, all pleasant with it to the eye, but altogether inuisible or indistinguishable without it: so for mine owne part, I must professe, that such historicall narrations, poeticall fictions, or other conceits of Heathens as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues knew little vse of, nor should I haue done had I beene as they were, being compared with this heauenly light of Gods word, did much affect me euen in my best and most retired meditations of sacred mysteries, their obseruation, as it were, tied my soule by a new knot, or fest, more surely
<pb facs="tcp:7863:5"/> vnto that truth, which I knew before to be in it selfe most sure, most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Yea euen in points wherein my heart, vnto my seeming, was best established, it much did nourish, augment, and strengthen beleefe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die planted, to obserue the perfect consonancie of profane, with sacred writers, or the occasions of their dissonancy, to be euidently such, as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures specifie: that of many euents wondred at by their heathenish rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, no tolerable reason could be giuen, but such as are subordinate to the neuer-failing rules of Scripture. And whosoeuer will, may (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume) obserue by experiment, the truth of what I say. There is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vnto beleefe so weake or feeble, but may be very auailable for quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling temptations of some kinde or other, eyther in speculation or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, oft-times such as are absolutely more weake or feeble, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for expelling some peculiar distrust or presumption, then others farre more forcible and strong for vanquishing temptations of another kinde, in nature most grieuous. Many, halfe students, halfe gallants, are often tempted eyther to distrust the commendatiōs of this Eden which we are set to dresse, or distast the food of life that grows within it, from delights sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested by profane bookes, wherewith commonly they are first acquainted, and hence much affect the knowledge their Authors profer, as likely to deifie them in the worlds eyes. Our pronenesse to be thus perswaded, is a witnesse of our first parents transgression, and these suggestions as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Sathans baites, whereby he wrought their bane. But what is the remedie? not to tread in any heathenish soile, least these serpents sting vs? rather the best medicine for this maladie would be a confection of that very flesh wherein such deadly poyson lodged. Other arguments may more perswade the iudicious, or such as in some measure haue tasted the fruits of the spirit: But none the curious artist better, then such as are gathered from his esteemed Authors Euen such as are in faith most strong, of zeale most ardent, should not much mispend their time, in comparing the degenerate fictions or historicall relations of times anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or moderne, with the euerlasting truth. For, though this methode could not adde much increase, eyther to their faith, or zeale: yet would it doubtlesse much auaile for working placide and milde affections. The very penmen of sacred writ themselues were taught patience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the waies of Gods prouidence, by their experience of such euents as the course of time is neuer barren of, not alwaies related by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Authors, nor immediately testified by the spirit, but oft-times beleeued vpon a morall certaintie, or such a resolution of circumstances
<pb facs="tcp:7863:6"/> concurrent into the first cause or disposer of all affaires, as wee might make of moderne accidents, were we otherwise partakers of the Spirit, or would we minde heauenly matters as much as earthly.</p>
                  <p>Generally two points I haue obserued, not much for ought I know, if handled at all by any writer: albeit their fruite and vse would fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the best paines of any one mans life-time, though wholly spent in their discussion, whose want in my mind hath beene the bane of true deuotion in most ages. The first is an equiualencie of means in the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God so proportioned to the diuersity of times, as no age could haue better then the present, howsoeuer they may affect the extraordinarie signes and wonders of former generations. Of this argument here and there, as occasion shall serue in this worke; elswhere at large, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. The second is an equiualencie of errours, hypocrisie, infidelitie, and idolatry, all which varie rather their shape then substance, in most men, through ages, nations, and professions, the ignorance of God remaining for the most part the same, his attributes as much (though in another kinde) transformed by many in outward profession ioyned with the true Church, as in times past by the heathen. The truth of which assertion, with the originall causes of the error, &amp; means to preuent it, are discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at large in the article of the Godhead. Many likewise for ought their consciēce (because not rightly examined) wil witnesse to the contrary, are strongly perswaded they loue Christ with heart &amp; soule, and so detest as well the open blasphemy or professed hatred, which the Iew; as the secret enmity the Iesuit or other infamous heretiks, beare against him: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From the manner of Ierusalēs progresse to her first destruction, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of the Iews naturall temper (the principal subiect of my subcisiue
<pb facs="tcp:7863:6"/> or vacant houres from these meditations &amp; other necessary imployments of my calling) I haue obserued the originall as well of most states as mens miscarriages professing true religion, to haue bin from presumption of Gods fauour before dangers approch, &amp; distrust of his mercy after cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities seaze vpon thē: the root of both these misperswasions to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or error in the doctrine of Gods prouidence, whose true knowledge (if I may so speak) is the fertile womb of all sacred moral truths, the only rule of rectifying mens wils, perswasions &amp; affections, in all consultatiōs or practises priuat or publik. Vnto this purpose much would it auaile to be resolued, whether all things fal out by fatal necessity, or some contingētly; how fate &amp; contingency (if cōpatible each with other) stand mutually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, how both subordinate to the absolute immutability of that one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting decree. Want of resolutiō in these points (as far as my obseruation serues me) hath continually bred an vniuersal threefold want: of care &amp; vigilancy for preuenting dangers in thēselues auoidable: of alacrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors to redeeme time in part surprised by them; of patience, of hearty submissiō to Gods will, &amp; constant expectation of his prouidence, after all hope of redēption from tēporal plagues long threatned by his messengers, is past. For here we suppose (what out of the fundamētal principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religiō shal in good time be made euidēt) that in all ruinated states or forepast alterations of religiō from better to worse, there was a time wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in the possibility of misfortunes which afterwards befell thē, might haue bin preuēted, a time wherin they might haue bin recouered frō eminent dangers, wherewith they were encompast, a time after which there was no possibility left them of auoiding the day of visitation, neuer brought forth but by the precedent fulnesse of iniquity, but alwaies necessarily by it. In the discussion of these &amp; other points of like nature (because more depending vpon strict examination of consequences deduced from the vndoubted rules of Scripture, then vpon authorities of antiquity, skil in the tongues, or any other learning that required long experience or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation) I laboured most, whilst those arts and sciences which are most conducible to this search, were freshest in my memory. And could I hope to satisfie others in all or most of these, as fully as I haue long since done my selfe, I should take greatest pleasure in my pains addressed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But would it please the Lord in mercy to raise vp some English writer, that could in such sort handle these points, as their vse and consequence, or necessitie of present times requires: succeeding ages (I am perswaded) should haue more cause to blesse the day of his natiuitie, then of the greatest States-mens or stoutest warriours this land hath
<pb facs="tcp:7863:7"/> yeelded since the birth of our Fathers this day liuing. It shall suffice me to beginne the offering with my mite, in hope some learned Academicks (for vnto them belongs the conquest of this golden fleece) will imploy their talents to like publike vse. What I conceiue, shall be (by Gods assistance) vnfolded in as plaine and vnoffensiue termes, as the nature of the subiect will beare, or my faculties reach vnto, partly in the Article of Gods prouidence, partly in other discourses directly subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, for the full and perfect grouth, at least for the sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant flourishing of liuely faith, one of the most effectuall meanes our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie that can but plant or water, attaines vnto, would bee to vnfold the harmonie betwixt propheticall predictions and historicall euents concerning the kingdome of Christ, and time of the Gospell: a point, for ought I know, not purposely handled by any moderne writer, except those whose successe cannot be great, vntill their delight in contention and contradiction be lesse. Notwithstanding, whatsoeuer I shall finde good in them or any other, without all respect of persons, much more without all desire of opposition, or occasion of contention (a matter alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent in a Christian, but most odious and loathsome in a Subiect so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious and pleasant,) I will not be afraid to follow, intending a full Trea-tise of the diuers kindes of prophecies, with the manner of their interpretations, before the Articles of Christs Incarnation, Passion, and Ascension.</p>
                  <p>These are the especiall points, which for the better confirmation of true Christian faith, and rectifying perswasions in matters of manners or good life, are principally aymed at in these meditations. The maine obstacle the Atheist stumbles at, is the Article of the bodies resurrection. Whose passiue possibilitie shall by (Gods assistance) be euidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated against him by the vndoubted rules of nature, whose Priest or Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nister he professeth himselfe to be. That <hi>de facto</hi> it shall be, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whose truth ere then will appeare diuine, must assure vs; Nature cannot, though thus much were in some sort knowne and beleeued by many naturall men from traditions of the ancient, or suspected from some notions of the law of nature not quite obliterated in all sorts of the heathen, as shall in that Article (God willing) be obserued. But why our assent vnto this and all other Articles in this Creed, being in good measure established, the momentarie hopes or transitorie pleasures of this world, should with most in their whole course of life, with all of vs

Doubtlesse, had the heathen Philosophers but knowne or suspected such ioyes as we professe we beleeue and hope for, or such a death, or more then deadly torments, as after this life ended we might feare; their liues and manners would as farre haue surpassed the best Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now liuing, as their knowledge in supernaturall mysteries came short of the most learned that are or haue beene in that profession: and yet whatsoeuer helpes any Christian or heathen had for increasing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or bettering manners, are more plentifull in this then any precedent age, so that the fault is wholly in our selues, that will not apply medicines alreadie prepared, as shall (God prospering these procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings) be declared in the last Article of this Creed.</p>

For this reasō haue I built with one hand, &amp; vsed my weapon with the other: laying the positiue or generall grounds of faith against the Infidell or Atheist in the first booke, and guarding them in the second by the sword of the spirit, against all attempts of Romish <hi>Sanballets</hi> or <hi>Tobiahs,</hi> who stil labour to perswade our people, the walles of Christs Church heere erected since our fore fathers redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from captiuitie, vnlesse supported by their supposed infallibilitie, are so weake,<note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>That happily will cause others to suspend their iudgements, which for a long time did retardate my perswasion, and inhibite my assent vnto the truth I there deliuered. For albeit the reasons there alleaged seemed very probable, whilest weighed apart, but farre more pregnant from comparing the concurrence of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which had led me to that opinion: yet on the other side strange it seemed, that my best grounds being borrowed from the relation of antiquitie, no ancient writer, liuing shortly after those times, should haue obserued the like. But whilst I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe, how the Almightie, whether, in his iust iudgement fot the sinnes of that present, or, in his wisedome and mercie for the greater good of future generations, had depriued vs of all their sacred meditations, that liued about <hi>Titus</hi> his time, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after: both effects, as I conceiued, might haue one and the same iust cause, though secret and onely knowne to God, not fit for vs to make any further inquirie after, then might stirre vs
<pb facs="tcp:7863:14"/> vp to true admiration of his wisedome. And truly admirable his wisedome seemed in this, that the Canon of the new Testament being finished in the most knowne tongue then extant in the world, (in which respect besides others, <hi>The Gospell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might be truly said to be preached through the whole, for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to all Nations</hi>) he would haue it seuered from all other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as well by the subsequent as precedent silence of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall sacred writers. He that would not haue any Prophet in Israell after the erection of the second Temple, would not for the same cause onely knowne to him, haue any writings of men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise most religious and deuout, to be extant in the age imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following the Gospels promulgation, that it thus shining like a solide or compact glorious starre in the transparant spheare, enuironed euery where with vacuitie, might more clearely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it selfe by it owne light be to supercelestiall.</p>
                  <p>Necessarie it was the period of that generation, wherein our Sauiour liued and died, should haue the diuine truth of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell confirmed vnto them by signes (as the<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.30.</note> Prophet speakes) <hi>in the heauens and in the earth,</hi> to increase their care and diligence in commending it to posteritie, who were to relie on it immediatly, not on their fore-fathers relation of signes past, the like or more effectuall, and as fully answerable to the rules set downe in it, they could not want; so long as they carried soules or minds carefull to obserue and practise what it prescribed. And who knowes whether the Lord had not appointed, that the serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those prodigious signes, which followed the publishing of the Gospell, should sleepe in all or most intermediate ages, till these latter daies wherein we liue, wherein such obseruations are more seasonable, as we being the men on whom the latter ends of the world are come. Happily had Ecclesiasticke writers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented vpon those times, our curious moderne wits, too much addicted vnto Gentilisme, would haue giuen lesse credence to the pregnant testimonies of profane Authors, as suspecting, lest Christians, in whose custodie their writings for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue beene, had infected either the whole discourses or some peculiar circumstances pertinent to their purposes, or apt to countenance their opinions, otherwise improbable in the worlds iudgement. But now, by how much the silence of Ecclesiasticke
<pb facs="tcp:7863:14"/> Authors in these narrations hath beene greater, and the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of heathen writers more plentifull or pregnant, so much the more vnexcusable is the curious vnregenerate <hi>Artist,</hi> or incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Athist.</hi> That most generations, since those times whereof we treat, should expect signes in the Sunne, and Moone, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of iudgement, cannot seeme either strange in it selfe, or preiudiciall to this doctrine which we deliuer, if we call to mind how men otherwise truly religious haue beene vsually ignorant, or mistaken in the meaning of diuine mysteries, vntill the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Reuelation, or vntill they vnfold their enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall construction by the approch or reall existence of the euents foretold. Thus many well affected to our Sauiour and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine did expect <hi>Elias</hi> should come before the kingdome were restored to <hi>Israel,</hi> euen whilst they had <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> of whom that prophecie was properly meant, amongst them, yea after hee had sealed his embassage with his bloud. Euen in the Apostles time, That our Sauiour should instantly come to giue final iudgement, was an opinion (as it seemes from S. <hi>Paul</hi> his admonition to the<note n="b" place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.1.2.</note>
                     <hi>Thessalonians</hi>) generally receiued amongst Christians: first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned as is most probable, from misconstruction of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours prophesie, <hi>Verily I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe till all these things be done,</hi> and this misconstruction caused from a a common erour or ignorance in not distinguishing betwixt the typicall and the mysticall or substantiall sense of prophesies, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, both alike literally and necessarily imported in the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same words.</p>
                  <p>From this errour of Christians in misapplying our Sauiours words, vnto the substance, which, for that time, were onely appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the type, was the like tradition propagated to the heathen of those times: as may be gathered from<note n="c" place="margin">Luca. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <p>The Romanes might well haue taken their martyred Poet for a Prophet, at least in this prediction, when within few yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they did behold the Sunne, and Moone, with all the host and powers of heauen, tragically acting what he had pend. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes conceit of that ruefull spectacle, whose admiraration had brought her great Philosopher, natures curious secretarie, to his vntimely death, in <hi>Dions</hi> words was thus: <hi>Postremo tantus fuit cinis, vt inde peruenerit in Africam, Syriam, &amp; Aegyptum, introie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit{que} Romam, eiusque aerem compleuerit, &amp; solem obscurauerit.

                           <p n="2">2 That beliefe is an assent; that to beleeue is to assent, all agree: but what more besides assent is required to some, especially to Christian beliefe, is much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed amongst Diuines: of which (God willing) in the Articles following.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 That euident certaintie, either of sense or vnderstanding, must be excluded from the assent, which is properly called beliefe, is euident and certaine by our vsuall and common speech. Thus whiles we demaund of him that relates any thing vnto vs for true (as newes or the like) whether he know his relation to be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, or no: if he neither haue immediately heard nor seene the things which he relates, but haue onely taken them at the second hand, his vsuall answere is: Nay, I know not certainly, but I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> they are true, for diuers reasons and credible reports: but if he had either seene or heard them himselfe, he would not say, I beleeue, but, I know they are most true. For euident certaintie doth drowne beliefe.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Yet is this euident knowledge (whether sensitiue or intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) to be excluded only from the thing it selfe which is to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly beleeued, not from other things that are linked or vnited to it by nature.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 That which we euidently know, may oft-times be the cause, why we beleeue some other matters, that haue affinity with it. As he that seeth it very light in the morning, when he first openeth his eyes, may probably beleeue the Sunne is vp, because he euidently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7863:24"/> seeth the ayre to be light. But no man (if you should aske him the same question) would say, that hee beleeued the Sunne was vp, when either the heate thereof doth scortch his face, or the beames dazell his eyes; for now he knoweth this trueth directly and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in it selfe. Nor is there any man that hath his right minde, that will say he verily beleeueth twice two make foure: for this is euident, and certaine to ordinarie capacities, and hee that onely beleeueth this, knoweth nothing. For what men know certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently, they will not say, they only beleeue, but know: what they so know not, they may truely and properly say, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, if their assent to it be greater than to the contrary.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 Some againe distinguish this vneuident assent (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called beliefe) from other assents or opinions, by the grounds on which it is built. The ground of it (in their opinion) is <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas docentis,</hi> the authoritie of the teacher or auoucher of the points proposed to be beleeued.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 This distinction in some cases is true, but it is not necessarie to all beliefe; nor doth it fully and properly distinguish beleefe from other vneuident assents or perswasions. For euen those as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents or perswasions, which seeme most to relie vpon authorities, may be strengthened by other motiues or inducements: yea our beliefe, or relying vpon authorities, vsually (alwayes if it be strong) ariseth from experiment of our Authors fidelity and skill, as shall appeare hereafter. For our present proceedings we take it here as granted or supposed, that this word <hi>[Beleefe]</hi> as it is vsually taken, is more generall than that assent or perswasion, which relies vpon authoritie; yet not so generall, as to comprehend these assents or perswasions, which are euidently certaine.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 It may be obiected, that the Apostle calleth euident know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, beliefe, when he saith, The diuells beleeue there is a God, and tremble. For it should seeme, that the diuels know as euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there is a God, as we do that the Sunne did shine but yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, or this morning. For they once enioyed the presence of God, and sawe his glorie, and since haue had euident experience of his power.</p>
                           <p n="9">9 Of Gods being (no doubt) they haue euident certaintie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit of his other attributes their knowledge is not so directly nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, but coniecturall, or a kind of beliefe. Wherefore vnto this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7863:25"/> place of our Apostle we may answere two wayes: Either that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this word <hi>[Beliefe]</hi> he comprehends not onely their assent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the being, or existence of the Godhead; but their assent vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributes of God, which they know not so euidently, and therefore may be said to beleeue them. Or if he vnderstand onely that assent, which they gaue vnto the existence or beeing of the Godhead, he calleth this (though ioyned with euident knowledge) a beliefe, in opposition or with reference vnto the beliefe of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites (against whom he there speakes) which was much lesse than this assent of diuells. For albeit that which is greater in the same kind, cannot be properly and absolutely said to be the lesse; as wee cannot properly and absolutely say that foure is three, but rather containes three in it: yet vpon some reference of the greater vnto the lesse contained in it, or vnto some other third, we may deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the greater with the name of that which is lesse in the same kind: as wee may say of him that promised three and gaue foure, that he gaue three, because three is contained in foure. So the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher saith, that <hi>Habitus est dispositio,</hi> euery habite is a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not absolutely and properly, for it is more; yet because it is more, with reference vnto that which is lesse, or vnto the subiect in whom it is, we may say it is <hi>dispositio,</hi> that is, it containes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in it, albeit no man would say that <hi>habitus</hi> were <hi>dispositio,</hi> if he should define it.</p>
                           <p n="10">10 And men vsually obiect to such as scoffe at matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that the day will come, wherein, if they repent not, they shal beleeue the things which now they little regard. Albeit they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said in that day to beleeue them, if wee speake properly and absolutely, without reference to their former incredulitie. Our meaning is, they shall doe more than beleeue them, for they shall feele them. Nor can we say properly, that the elect after the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shall beleeue the articles of faith: seeing all agree, that of these three principall vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Loue,</hi> onely Loue shall then remaine. The reason is that which you haue heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; because euident knowledge must be excluded from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith and beliefe; and the godly shall then clearely see Christ face to face, and fully enioy the fruit of his passion, which now they only beleeue.</p>
                           <p n="11">11 As for certaintie, we may not exclude it from the nature
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7863:25"/> of beliefe, vnlesse this speech be warily vnderstood. For the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the articles of our saith ought to be greater, than the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of other knowledge; for we must beleeue them, although they be contrarie to the capacitie of our vnderstanding: for euen this must we beleeue, that many things (as all supernatural things) surpasse the reach of our vnderstanding. Yet this we may safely say, that the certaintie of the articles of our beliefe, [as of Christ his death, of his and our resurrection,] cannot be so great to vs in this life, as it shall be in the world to come, when we shall euidently know them. This rule then is infallible; that the knowledge of any thing is more certaine, than the beliefe thereof: although the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of some things (as of Christ his passion) bee more certaine, than the knowledge of other things; as namely, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humane sciences. So then out of this it is euident, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, taken generally, doth neither exclude all certaintie, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily require any; seeing some beliefe hath a kind of certaintie adioyned with it, and some cannot admit it. Wherefore it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that assent is the essence of beliefe in generall; I say such an assent, as is not ioyned with euidencie.</p>
                           <p n="12">12 This assent may be weaker or stronger, and so come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto, or be further from certaintie, according to the nature of that obiect, whereunto we giue assent; or according to the nature of that, whereupon our beliefe is grounded; or lastly, according to our apprehension either of the obiect, or that which is the ground of our assent. Excesse in the first of these [to wit, in certaintie or stabilitie of the obiect] doth rather argue a possibilitie of firmer beliefe, or more credibilitie; not more firme or actuall beliefe. For as many things are more intelligible than others, and yet are least vnderstood of many: so many that are most credible, are least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.</p>
                           <p n="13">13 Excesse in the second of these, whence the assent of beliefe may be strengthened, [that is, in the ground of beliefe,] doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argue a stronger hypotheticall beliefe, than any absolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe; vnlesse the apprehension or conceit of this ground be strong and liuely. In ordinary reports or contracts, it skils not of what credit the partie be, vnto whose credence or authoritie we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for the truth of any promise or report; vnlesse wee haue good inducements to thinke, that he did either say, or promise as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7863:26"/> we were told. If we be not thus perswaded by some apprehension of our owne; we giue onely conditional assent vnto the report or promise, and beleeue both with this limitation, [if he say so, whose credit wee so esteeme.] But if we can fully apprehend that he said so; we beleeue absolutely.</p>
                           <p n="14">14 As in science or demonstrations it is requisite, both that we know the true cause of the effect, and also that we apprehend it certainly as the true cause; (otherwise we haue only an opinion:) so in true and absolute beliefe it is requisite, that we haue both a sure ground of our beliefe, and a true apprehension of that ground▪ otherwise our beliefe must needs be conditionall, not absolute. It remaineth therefore that we set downe, first the nature of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects that may be beleeued: secondly, the seuerall grounds of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: and thirdly, the manner of apprehending them, albeit in some the apprehension of the obiect in it selfe, and the ground of beliefe, are in a sort all one; as in that beliefe, which is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the auhoritie of the teacher. This rule is generall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the obiects are in themselues more credible, the ground may be more strong, and the apprehension more liuely, so men be capable of it, and industrious to seeke it: and equall apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of such obiects as are more credible in themselues, (vpon such grounds as are more firme) makes the beliefe stronger, than it could be of obiects lesse credible, or vpon grounds lesse firme. <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> euery one of these three, first, Greater credibilitie of the obiect, secondly, Surer ground of beliefe, thirdly, More liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehension of the obiect or ground, encrease beliefe.</p>
                           <p n="15">15 For the obiects of beliefe, (whence this assent must bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,) they are either naturall, or supernaturall; but first of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> which is naturall. The obiects of naturall beliefe are of two sorts, either <hi>scibilia,</hi> or <hi>opinabilia;</hi> either such things as may be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently knowne in themselues, but are not so apprehended by him that beleeues them; or else such things, as we can haue no euident or certaine knowledge of, but onely an opinion. And of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are all the monuments of former ages, and relations of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, in respect of vs which are now liuing: all future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or such effects, as haue no necessarie naturall cause why they should bee, nor no ineuitable let or hinderance why they may not be; as whether wee should haue raine or faire weather the next
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7863:26"/> moneth, whether such or such nations shall wage warre against each other the next yeare. These matters past, and contingent which are not yet, but may be, albeit they agree in the generall nature of <hi>opinabilia,</hi> that neither of thē can be exactly knowne, but only by opiniō beleued: yet both differ in that which is the ground of our assent or beliefe. The ground or reason why we beleeue things past, (as that <hi>Tully</hi> liued in <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> time, or that the Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inhabited this land,) is the report of others. The ground or reason why we beleeue future contingents, is the inclination or propension which we see in second causes to produce such effects; or the coherence betwixt any naturall or morall contingent cause, &amp; their possible or probable issue. As if we see one kingdom migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie in wealth, &amp; at peace &amp; vnitie in it selfe, bearing inueterate hate to another; or if we know that the one hath suffered wrong, not likely to be recompenced, and yet able in politique estimation to make it selfe amends: we beleeue that such will shortly be at open hostilitie one with another. Or if we see the ayre waterish, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it will shortly be rainy. Yet are not the grounds why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue things past, and the grounds of beleeuing future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, alwayes so opposite, but that they may iumpe in one, and conspire mutually for the strengthening of beliefe. For we would beleeue our former coniecture of warre or weather a great deale the better, if a cunning States-man should giue iudgement of the one, or an Astronomer, or some that we know very weather-wise, his opinion of the other. For now, besides the probabilitie of our owne coniectures, we haue other mens authoritie to confirme our beliefe. In both kinds (either where the grounds of each are seuerall, or where both conspire together) as the ground of beliefe, or our apprehension of the ground is greater, so our beliefe wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth stronger. THVS we beleeue the Romane stories of <hi>Caesars</hi> times more firmely, than the relations of <hi>Herodotus</hi> concerning matters of Aegypt, or other countries; because more Writers, and they such as are lesse suspected of vanitie or imposture, do testifie the truth of Romane affaires.</p>
                           <p n="16">16 Other things, which are credible, or may be beleeued, are (as we said) <hi>scibilia;</hi> such things as may be exactly knowne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>l reason, though not of the partie which only beleeues them; (for exact knowledge alwayes expels meere beliefe of the same
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7863:27"/> thing in the same partie.) That the Sunne is bigger than the earth, or that the motion thereof is swifter than any arrowes flight, may bee knowne exactly by a Mathematician; but ordinarie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men (such as are not rustically wayward) do beleeue it; eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and exactly know it they cannot. <hi>The ground</hi> of their beliefe in such a case is <hi>authoritas docentis.</hi> And this authoritie of teachers, or others, vpon whose assertions we rely, consisteth partly in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the teachers or relators skill in those matters which he teacheth or relateth; and partly in his honestie, fidelitie, or veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his dealings, or sayings. And as these are reputed greater, so do we more beleeue him in these things which he auoucheth for true, and rely more securely vpon his authoritie. For as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Caeteris paribus,</hi> the certaintie of beliefe encreaseth as the ground of beliefe doth, both for the number of points belieued, and for the firmenesse of the beliefe it selfe. If two of the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie teach vs diuers things, whereof we haue no other ground but their assertion, we beleeue him better, whose skill and fidelitie we account of better; and the more the parties be that report or auouch the same thing, the more we beleeue them, if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted skilfull and honest. And where the authoritie is the same, both for extension and degrees: yet we beleeue the things taught better, from the better or more immediate apprehension of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. As if <hi>Aristotle, Euclide,</hi> or <hi>Archimedes</hi> were aliue, and in that reputation for skill in their seuerall professions, which their workes are in; we would beleeue those conclusions, which wee heard them teach, better than such as we had from them by others, or (as we said) at the second hand. For though the authoritie in both cases were the same: yet should not our apprehension of it be so; but more immediate in the former. We see by daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how opinions, only grounded vpon the authoritie of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for their skill in such matters well reputed of, doe inforce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (especially inferiours in that kind of skill) to giue an assent vnto the same truth, although they haue good shew of reason to the contrarie. As what country-man is there, but would thinke he might safely sweare, that the earth were an hundred times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Sunne? yet if an Astronomer, (of whose skill he hath had experience in other matters, which he can better discerne) one whom he knew to be an honest plaine dealing man, not accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7863:27"/> to cog with his friend, should seriously auouch the contrarie, <hi>that the Sunne is bigger then the earth;</hi> few country men would be so wayward as not to beleeue their friend Astronomer, albeit (his authoritie set aside) they had no reason to thinke so, but rather the contrarie. And it were a signe of ignorant arrogancie, if punies or fresh-men should reiect the axiomes and principles of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> vsuall in the schooles, because they haue some reasons against them, which themselues cannot answere. For reason might tell them, that others (their betters) which haue gone before them, haue had greater reasons to hold them, then they can yet haue to deny them. This perswasion of other mens skill or knowledge will winne the assent of modest and ingenuous youths, vnto such rules or axiomes, as otherwise they would stiffely deny, and haue wittie reasons to ouerthrow. But albeit this assent, which men giue to conclusions, they know not themselues, but onely beleeue vpon other mens asseuerations, may be very great; as many country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will beleeue an Astronomer affirming that the Sun is greater then the earth, better then they will the honestest of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in a matter that may concerne both their commodities: yet if the relators or auouchers could make them conceiue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reason of the same conclusions, [as if the Astronomer in the mentioned case could shew, how euery body the further it is from vs seemeth the lesse, and then declare how many hundred miles the Sunne is from vs:] mens minds would be a great deale better satisfied, and this assent or beliefe, which formerly did onely relie vpon authoritie, would be much strengthened by this second tie or hold-fast. And if we would obserue it, there is vsually a kind of regresse betwixt our beliefe of authorities, and our assent vnto conclusions taught by them. First (vsually) we beleeue authoritie, and afterwards the conclusions taught by it, for the authorities sake. But after we once find experiment of the truth of conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so taught, we beleeue the authoritie the better from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall truth of the conclusion.</p>
                           <p n="17">17 But of all these acceptions and degrees of beliefe or assent, something may be gathered for better expressing the seuerall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of true Christian beliefe; which like <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder reacheth from earth to heauen.

Such are the mysteries of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the articles of christian beliefe. For no article of our beliefe (if we consider them with all the circumstances, and in that exact manner as they are proposed in Scripture to be beleeued) could euer haue come into corrupted mens cogitation, vnlesse God had reuealed it vnto him.

                           <p n="3">3 And if the Heathen were of opinion, that the Gods did not enuie men knowledge; then must they needes beleeue, that if they taught them any, they would teach them true knowledge. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this must be laid downe as a certaine ground, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God teacheth vs, is most true. Nor is there any (admitting there were a God) but would assent vnto this. But here is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. How can we be assured that God doth teach vs any of these things? Or, how shall we know, that this wee call Scripture, is the word of God? If our apprehension of this ground be sure, our faith is firme and absolute: if our apprehension hereof be doubtfull, our faith must needs be vnstable, or, at the best, but conditionall.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Let vs first therefore looke what this conditionall assent or beliefe doth bind vs vnto.</p>
                           <p>Although many, that firmely beleeue whatsoeuer God saith, is true, either doe not acknowledge or doe not firmely beleeue that these Scriptures are the word of God: yet thus much in all sense and reason any naturall man will grant; there bee great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and probabilities, why they should be taken for the word of God. And he that doth acknowledge but thus much, doth by this acknowledgement bind himselfe to reuerence them aboue all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writings. For all men naturally know, that if they be Gods word, they are worthy all possible reuerence. Wherefore if a man suppose it only as probable, that they are, or know nothing ro the contrary why they may not be Gods word: he is bound to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and esteeme them aboue all words or writings of man. As for example; If any subiect in this land should receiue letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some lawfull and indifferent request from any other his equal or fellow subiect, whom he had great reason wel to respect; suppose he certainly knew that they were such a mans letters, and no counterfaite: yet if hee should receiue letters in his Maiesties name, containing the same or other as reasonable request: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knew not so certainly that these were his Maiesties let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7863:29"/> as that the others were some wel-respected Subiects, yet is he in duty bound to vse them with greater respect and reuerence, than the former. The bare presumption and probabilitie that they were the Kings letters, doth bind him to inquire further, whether they were his Letters or no: nor were his fault excusable, if hee should shew any signe of disloyalty, or irreuerence towards them, vntill hee knew that they were not such, as their Title or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription did import.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 He that hath but the same probabilitie, that the Scriptures containe in them Gods owne wordes, as that <hi>Liuie</hi> his Histories containe the Roman affaires, must needs esteeme of them infinit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly aboue all humane workes. And this fruit hypotheticall or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed beliefe may bring forth, euen in the vnregenerate or natural man. And what hath beene said of reuerence to the Scriptures vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this supposall, is also most true of mans actions. If men doe but beleeue it as probable, that the Scriptures are the Word of God: this beliefe will procure many good morall actions, and much amendment of life; though not such spirituall perfection, as God in his word requireth. And the reasō of this assertion is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For we see daily, that men vndertake actions of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie and danger, not so much according to the probabilitie of attaining some good, as according to the greatnesse of that good which possibly may be attained. So we see many, that might liue in ease at home with certaintie of moderate gaines, to vndertake voyages to the West or East Indies, onely vpon this resolution, That if it be their lucke or lot to bee rich, there they may haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; although the aduenture bee subiect to great dangers, and obnoxious to infinite casualties. And many there be, that wil not vsually lay out a penny, but vpon very faire ground of some gaine or sauing thrift, who yet will be well content to venture a crowne or an angell in a Lotterie, where there may bee some possibilitie, though no probabilitie, of obtaining twentie or thirtie pounds. These and infinite other examples, obuious to daily experience, may serue as a perfect induction of our generall assertion: <hi>That the meere possibilitie of obtaining some great and extraordinary good, is of greater moment in swaying mens actions, than certaintie of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing pettie desires, or greatest probabilities of purchasing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie commodities or delights.</hi> To deduce then out of this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7863:29"/> generall the particular we intended: In the Scripture are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all such as loue God and do his will, farre greater blessings, than humane knowledge could euer haue conceiued. The like is true in auoyding dangers. Men oftentimes vndertake matters of more difficulty and charges, to preuent some grieuous mischaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which may insue, than they would doe to escape some immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but ordinary daunger, or to release themselues from some smaller harmes that already haue befallen them. Could men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these things seriously, and account of them but as probable: what is there in this life, which in any reason they should not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the obtaining of so great a good? Were men but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perswaded that there were (as the Scriptures and the articles of our Beliefe tell vs) a life euerlasting, full laden with all the fruites of true life, ioy, peace and all choisest pleasures, without any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance: how could they not be most readie, and willing to spend this whole transitorie life (whose dayes are but few, and most of them euill, full fraught with griefe and distresse) in the seruice of God, who would thus reward them? Yea, how could they not be desirous to lay downe this life it selfe, vpon hope of obtaining such a life? For this life compared to that to come, hath not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a farthing to whole millions of Golde, or all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in this world. Nor is the case herein like vnto that of aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Lotterie; where a man may venture his life, or goods if he list, but if hee doe not, none calleth him to an accompt for not doing it: But in the Scriptures euerlasting torments, griefe, and perpetuall horror are threatned to all such, as frame not their liues according to Gods will in them reuealed.</p>

For seeing in the Scriptures are proposed to euery mans choice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, or euerlasting death: what extreame madnesse is it for men to enter into any course of life, or to vndertake any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment, which may exact their chiefe imployments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue diligently looked to the maine chaunce? before they haue tried the vtmost of their wits, and others best aduise, to know the tenour of their owne estate? Wee see daily what great paines men of no small account doe take in the studie of Alchymie, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their spirites, and most of their substance in trying conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and searching out the truth of those things, for which they haue but weake grounds of Philosophie or reason; onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the good they aime at, (which is rather possible than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable for them to attaine) inforceth a kinde of hope, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to goe forward.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 To speake nothing of the good the Scripture promiseth, the very conceit of eternall death (me thinkes) should moue, either the Chymickes, (which spend much gold only vpon hope of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more) or any other man whatsoeuer, to spend all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, whatsoeuer either this their Art, or all other could yeeld, to secure themselues from such horrible torments, as the Scriptures
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7863:30"/> threaten to their Contemners or negligent Hearers. And why should not all men then in reason bestow most time and paines, in searching the truth of those things, which concerne their soules estate; whose securitie in all reason they should purchase with the highest hopes, and vtmost aime of all other trauelles in this life. Here then (as I said) the full height of mans iniquitie, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable madnesse, is most plainely discouered; that hauing these two motiues, which in naturall reason doe sway all humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, offering themselues to incourage him in searching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: yet notwithstanding most men bestow lesse labor in them, than in other ordinarie studies. First, if we compare the good they set before vs, as a recompence and reward of our trauelles, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all comparison greater than the scope of any other trade, or science. For here is a double infinitie of solid good; first, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise ioy two waies infinit, both in degree &amp; continuance; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they threaten vnto their contemners and despisers death and torments doubly infinite, both in degree and continuance. Now if the probabilities of the truth of Scriptures were farre lesse, than is vsually found in other studies, or humane hopes: yet could this in humane reason be no reason why wee should labour lesse in them, than in other affaires; seeing the incomparable excesse of the good they promise, doth aboundantly recompence this. But if the probabilitie of the truth of Scripture, be in naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son equall to the probabilities which men vsually take for their grounds in many greatest attempts; then certainly not to bestow as great paines and trauell, in trying the truth of their promises, as in any other humane attempts, or affaires, doth argue infinit mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Aske we the Chymick, what reason he hath to toile so much in the studie of <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> or other intricate writers of his facultie; (the like we may say of any Physitians:) their answere (as you may reade in their writings) is this: Many Philosophers in former ages haue laboured much in this studie, and haue set downe good rules of their experiments; who (as is probable) would neuer haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken such paines vpon no ground. And verily this tradition, or the authoritie they giue to their Writers, is their chiefe motiue. For I thinke few of their ancient Authors haue bequeathed to their successors any gold made by this art, thereby to encourage them. If then tradition, consent of time, or approbation of authors, or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7863:31"/> relation of experiments, be an especiall inducement for men to aduenture their charge, paines, and trauell in this facultie, as in all other affaires: without all controuersie the Scriptures in all these motiues haue an especiall prerogatiue aboue all other faculties or sciences, albeit humane reason were admitted iudge. For the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Gods Church is farre more generall, then the consent of any writers in one faculty whatsoeuer. The consent of time like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is greater. For no age since Christs time in these ciuill parts of the world, but by the report of other Writers, as well as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, hath yeelded obedience vnto Scriptures as the word of God. Men of most excellent spirits and learning in euery age, haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted their studies vnto this truth. About the time of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours comming, curious arts, and other ciuill disciplines did most flourish. The Grecians sought after wisdome and secular Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie with the like; the Romans after policie, state-knowledge, and discipline of warre; all the world almost, (aboue others, those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein Christianitie was first planted) was then set vpon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arts: yet we see how the studie and search of Scriptures in short time did proue, as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod amongst the Magitians ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. It hath deuoured all, and brought them to acknowledge allegiance vnto it; vsing the helpe of best secular arts, as it were nutriment for the growth of Christianitie, and expelling the rest as excrements out of the Church. Nor can the Atheist name any age, wherein the Heathen had an <hi>Oliuer</hi> to oppugne our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Porphyrius in vita Plautini.</note> but we had a <hi>Rowland</hi> to defend it: if they had a <hi>Porphyrie</hi> or <hi>Celsus</hi> to oppose philosophie against it, we had an <hi>Origen</hi> (a man, by their owne confession, of the most rare wit and hope for philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie then liuing,) to forsake philosophie and follow Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It was not despaire which made him and many other excellent schollers, Christians: but the sure hope which they found in this profession, made them contemne all other hopes, and cleaue to it with their hearts and soules; albeit their soules should for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be violently separated from their bodies. This triall, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, few of their greatest Philosophers would haue endured; but they had the potentates of the world, as readie to applaud them, as to disgrace the Christians; and yet the Christians multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as the Israelites did by oppression in Aegypt.

The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others were but ordinarie and naturall; these are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie and supernaturall. If the Atheist should impudently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth of their report: we may conuince him with Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> acute dilemma. If the miracles related by our Writers be true, they giue euident experiment of the truth of Scripture: if there were no such particular miracles, but all feigned; then this was a miracle aboue all miracles, that Christian religion should preuaile against all other arts, power, or policie, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary euent or miracle. It was not so easie a matter to cozen all the Romane Emperours, and their deputies, with feigned tales; the world, which hated Christians so much, was inquisitiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know the truth of their reports. I may conclude; <hi>nisi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas magna fuisset non praeualuisset.</hi> It was miraculous, doubtlesse, that it should so encrease without armes; without any promise of carnall pleasure, or securitie: but euen against their naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that did professe it, and all the worlds opposition against it. It had enemies both priuate and publike, domestique and forren, euen the flesh and sence of those which followed it fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7863:32"/> the most happy. But Christianitie from its first beginning, was to rowe against the streame of flesh and bloud, and to beare out saile against all the blasts that the diuell, world, or flesh could oppose against it. In a word, the increase of Mahumetisme hath followed the barbarous Turkish monarchies aduancement, as moysture in bodies doth the increasing fulnesse of the Moone. And it had bin an extraordinary miracle, if a barbarous multitude (neuer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any ciuill pleasures,) should not haue composed theyr mindes vnto their Emperours; in following a religion, framed, as it were, to court the senses, and wooe the flesh. But Christianitie then flourished most, when the scorching heat of persecution was at the height: When the countenance of Emperours, as terrible to their foes (for their heroicall valour) as plausible to their friends (for their louely carriage) were most fiercely set against it. What Princes either more terrible to their enemies, or more amiable to their friends, than <hi>Traian, Dioclesian,</hi> or others of the Christians persecutors were? What man liuing is there of ciuill education, that would not haue lothed <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the whole succession of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> familie, in respect of these Roman Princes? And yet a great part of their natiue subiects, men, as otherwise excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently qualified, so of a quiet and peaceable disposition; yet readie alwayes to venture their liues for these heathen Princes, in most dangerous seruice against the enemies of the Roman Empire, but most ready to follow the crucified Christ through fire and sword, against their Emperors command (dearer to them than this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life) and all the worlds threats, or allurements. It were sottish to thinke, that such men had not perfect notice of some higher powers commaundement to the contrarie, (whom they thought it safer to obey) when they contradicted the commaundements, or faire allurements of these supreame earthly powers. And it were as seely a persuasion to thinke, that, if the great Turke would change his religion for any other, that might yeeld like hopes of carnall pleasure after this life, any great number of his subiects would loose their dignities for refusing Subscription.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N other Inducement for beleeuing the truth of the Old Testament, is the harmonie of so many seuerall writers, liuing in such distance of Ages, handling such diuersitie of arguments, and couering them with stiles, for the maiestie of some, and the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie of others, more different, than <hi>Virgils</hi> verses, and the rudest countrymans talke; and yet all of them retaining the selfe same relish. Whiles we reade <hi>Tully, Virgil, Liuie, Salust</hi> and <hi>Ouid,</hi> though all liuing neare about one time; yet their writings differ as much as flesh &amp; fish. Many learned men like some one or few of these, and yet much mislike others, reputed as excellent writers in their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7863:36"/> kind, liuing about the same time: much more might he that should haue read the common or vulgar Historiographers, Poets, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of that time, haue contemned them as base in respect of the former. But the Prophets of the Old Testament, and the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers of the same, though differing infinitely in degrees of stile and inuention; yet agree as well in the substance or essentiall qualitie of their writings, as the same Pomander chafed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chafed. There is the same odour of life, and goodnesse in both, but more fragrant and piercing in the one than in the other. And no man that much likes the one, can mislike the other: hee may like it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="2">2 Many other inducements of this kind are set downe at large, by that Flower of France, and glorie of Christian Nobilitie, in the 24. and 25. chapters of his booke <hi>De Veritate Christianae religionis,</hi> of the Truth of Christian religion: as also in <hi>Ficinus</hi> and <hi>Viues,</hi> whose labours it is hard to say whether he hath more augmented or graced. One especiall motiue is from the drift, and scope of all these sacred writings; whether Histories, Prophets, Psalmes, or the Gospel. The end and scope of all these, is onely to set out the glorie of God, and the good of mankinde. In their most famous victories, and good successe of their best contriued policies, they ascribe the glorie wholly to God. There is no circumstance inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to erect the praise of man, not of the chiefest managers of such affaires. They account it the greatest praise that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto their Worthies, to let the world know they were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, and that God did fight for them. Not one Writer in this sacred volume bewraies the least signe of enuy towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that liued with him, or had gone before him: Not one that giueth the least suspition of seeking his owne praise by lessening others deserts, as if hee had corrected wherein others had erred, or finished what they had well begunne, but left imperfect. No imitation in any of them to let posterity vnderstand, that it should thinke it selfe beholding to them for their good directions. They seek no thanks, as if they vndertooke their labors voluntarily, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the good of others; but proclaime a necessitie laide vpon them, for doing that which they doe, and a woe, if they doe it not. They spare not to rehearse the iniquitie, and shame of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7863:37"/> and nearest kinsfolkes, with Gods fearefull iudgements vpon them for the same, to register their prince and peoples, or their owne disgrace (as the world counteth disgrace) to all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: so Gods name may thereby be more glorified, &amp; his church edified, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 9. <hi>verse</hi> 23, 24. <hi>Let not the wise man glorie in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor the strong man glorie in his strength: but let him that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth, glorie in that he vnderstandeth and knoweth the Lord. Ieremy</hi> himselfe reuealeth his owne slackenesse, in vndertaking his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed charge, <hi>Iere.</hi> 20. <hi>verse</hi> 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19: hee no where bewrayes any desire of praise, as if he had excelled all his equalls in wit: all that is good in him, or his people, hee giueth to God. <hi>Daniel,</hi> who did excell in the interpretations of dreames and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and had the estate of many kingdomes for many yeares to come reuealed vnto him; so as if he would haue chalenged the reuelation of his Countries returne from captiuitie, he could not haue bin disproued, yet ingeniously sheweth that he learned this out of the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremie, Dan.</hi> 9 <hi>verse</hi> 2. Although his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge was exceeding great, yet he affects not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Knowing aboue that measure, which God had giuen him, Rom.</hi> 12.3.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 This one qualitie (in them all) of not seeking their owne, nor their countries praise, but onely the praises of their God, and the profit of his church (if we consider it well) may sufficiently testifie, that they speake not vpon priuate motions, who were thus cleere from all suspition of priuat respects. Nor can we suspect, that they should thus conspire together vnto one end, from the will and purpose of man. For what man could limit others thoughts, or rule their wits which liued after him? Least of all can Chaunce be imagined the author of so many seuerall Writers constancie, in conspiring thus to one end in seuerall Ages. Let vs coniecture what causes we can, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> must resolue the doubt, 2. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>All of them spake as they were moued by the holy Spirit, which was present one and the same to all?</hi> If they had not spoken as they were moued by the Spirit, but as if they had moued themselues, to finde out matter, or stretched their wits to inlarge inuention: then would the later sort especially haue catched at many by-nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and inserted many <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, little pertinent to that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation which others had laied before them. But now wee see the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7863:37"/> continuall drift of their writings so seriously set vpon one and the selfe same end, as if they had all wrought by an others direction, who had cast the platforme of the edifice himselfe, not minded to finish his worke in any of the first worke-mens age: and yet will haue the later to beginne where the other left, without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or trickes of their owne inuention.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 All these properties of these sacred Writers, doe sufficiently witnesse their motiues to haue been Diuine, but more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whilest we consider the vanitie of the Iewish people, if we take them as they are by nature, not sanctified by the Spirite of God. For naturally they are giuen to magnifie their owne nation, more than any other people liuing, yea to make God beholding vnto them for their sanctitie: few of them would seek the praise of their God, but with reference to their owne. Hence our apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings it as an argumēt of the truth of his gospel, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. in that he <hi>did not preach himselfe but Christ Iesus the Lord, and himselfe their seruants for his sake,</hi> so doth our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. <hi>verse</hi> 18. <hi>He that speaketh of himselfe seeketh his owne glory, but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no vnrighteousnesse is in him.</hi> This sinceritie in teaching, (especially in a man of Iewish progenie) when it is tried to continue without all affectation or dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the true <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> or touchstone, the liuerie or cognisance of a man speaking by the Spirit of God. The like liue characters of sinceritie are not to be found in any else, saue only in these sacred Writers, or such as haue sincerely obeyed their doctrine. And in many of those Books which our Church accounts Apocryphall, there euidently appeares a spice of secular vanitie; howsoeuer the pen-men of them were truely religious sanctified men, and haue sought to imitate the writings of the Prophets, and other Writers of this sacred volume; But much more eminent is the like vanitie in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> a man otherwise as excellent for meere naturall parts, or artificiall learning, as his Countrey yeelded anie, not inferior to any Historiographers whatsoeuer.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Seeing in this whole bodie of Scriptures there appeares one and the same Spirit, albeit the members be of diuerse fashion and qualitie: this sacred volume it selfe may serue as a liuely type or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of that <hi>Vnitie of the Spirite in the bond of peace,</hi> which ought to be in the Church and mysticall bodie of Christ, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3.

And wee may see that verified in the Canon of the Old Testament, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes vnto the Church in Christ;<note place="margin">1. Corint. 12.4.</note>
                              <hi>There are diuersities of giftes, but the same Spirite.</hi>

But alas wee haue made a diuision in the bodie of Christ, whilest one of vs detracts, enuies or slaunders another; or whiles we wrangle vnmanerly about idle questions, or termes of art or iarres, (ours that haue the name of Christs messengers) make all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, and our selues oft-times (wee may feare) doubt of the true and reall vnitie betwixt Christ and his members, now eclipsed by our carnall diuisions. But howsoeuer, these here mentioned are in their kinde good motiues vnto sober minds; and the more diligent and attentiue men are to obserue these and the like, the more fully shall they be perswaded, that these writings are the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the holy Ghost.</p>

He that neuer had any himselfe may safely sweare, that most Poets ancient or moderne,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7863:38"/> haue had experience of wanton loues. For who can think that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus, Ouid,</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> had neuer beene acquainted with any but painted women, or written of loue matters onely as blinde men may talke of colours?

But much more sensible may wee feele the pulses of our Psalmists pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions beating their ditties, if wee would lay our hearts vnto them. Albeit wee seeke not to prooue their Diuine authoritie from the strength of passion simply, but from the obiects, causes, or issue of their passions.

And yet, he, well for health of bodie, onely oppressed with griefe of mind, most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to sequester himselfe from all solace, which his Court or Kingdome could afford, in hope to finde his company alone who was inuisible, and to renew acquaintance with his Spirite. <hi>Create a cleane heart (O God) and renew a right spirite within me. Cast mee not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirite from me.</hi> He accounts himselfe but as an exile, though liuing in his natiue soile, but as a slaue, though absolute Monarch ouer a mightie people; whilest hee stoode separate from the loue of his God, and liued not in subiection to his spirite. If one in hunger should loathe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie or course fare, wee would coniecture hee had beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to more fine and daintie meates.

For so hee addeth; <hi>Then shall I teach thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shall be conuerted vnto thee.

From the like aboundant experience of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ioy, the Psalmist in the threescore and sixt Psalme and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, bursteth out into like confident speeches; inuiting vs, as Christ did his Apostle <hi>Thomas,</hi> to come neere and lay our hands vpon his healed sore, and by the scarres to gather the skill and goodnesse of him that had thus cured him beyond all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation:

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7863:40"/> in this and the foure and fortieth Psalme, argue that those woonders and noble workes, which they had heard with their eares, and their fathers had told them, were no fables, but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters truely and really acted, which had left deepe impression in their forefathers hearts, who had so thorowly felt and tasted the extraordinarie goodnesse of their God, that the longing desire of like fauour is transfused as hereditarie to posteritie, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of such meates as parents best affect, and vse most to feede vpon, vsually remaines in their children.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Or, to vse the Author of the two and fortie Psalme his owne comparison; <hi>Braying</hi> doeth not more sensibly notifie the <hi>Hartes panting after the water brookes,</hi> than that Psalme doth his thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Spirite of Life; which sometime had beene diffused through his faculties, and had fructified in ioy and comfort, but now in these stormes of affliction lieth hid in his heart, onelie supporting it with hopes of like fruit against a better season; as the sap whereby trees flourish in Summer, retiring to the roote in Winter, preserueth them sound within, so that although frosts may nippe, and stormes outwardly deface them, yet they breake forth againe, and beare fruit in the Spring. And although I neuer mistrusted the truth of that dissension, betwixt the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse of the Spirite, and weakenesse of the flesh, oft mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture; yet, I know not how, it addeth more life to my beliefe, whilest I see this conflict acted by the Author of the two and fortie and the three and fortie Psalme. The flesh complaines, as if his heart were readie to close with deiected feare; <hi>My soule is cast downe within mee, all thy waues and flouds are gone ouer mee:</hi> the Spirite like a good Physitian, by reiterating that speech of comfort, <hi>Why arte thou cast downe, O my soule, and why art thou so disquieted within mee,</hi> raiseth it vp againe, and dilateth his heart with hope in God against all hope in worldly sight. For so hee concludeth both these Psalmes, <hi>Wait on God: for I will yet giue him thankes: hee is my present helpe and my God.</hi> Generally, though the Psalmists complaints bee oft-times grieuous, yet they neuer end them but with hearty praier; though God oft-times lay great plagues vpon them; yet is their confidence alwayes as great that hee will heale them. The beginning of their mournefull Ditties,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7863:40"/> alwayes represent the stormes of griefe and sorrow, that had gone ouer their soules: their end and cloze is like the appearing of the Morning Starre, fore-shewing the remoueall of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, wherein they sate. Their sodaine transitions from griefe to ioy, is euen as the breaking out of the Sunne from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thicke tempestuous cloude: So that the outward Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of theyr Songs, is a liuely representation of that trueth, which one of them out of his inmost experience hath left regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to the world; <hi>His wrath endureth but the twinckeling of an eie, and in his pleasure is life: heauinesse may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.</hi>

                           <p n="5">5 Other-whiles this Kingly Prophet expostulates the wrongs offered by his enemies so confidently, and relateth his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie in such patheticall and serious manner, that vnlesse the Inscription of his Petitions, or other historicall circumstance, did giue vs notice, to whome hee tendered his complaints, wee would thinke that they had beene so many reports, of what hee had openly pleaded at some Barre, or Court of ciuile Iustice, in the personall presence, sight, or audience of some visible Iudge, ready to giue sentence for him vpon the first hearing of his cause. If any ciuile Heathen, that neuer had heard of any inuisible God, should haue taken vp some of his Psalmes (the ninth for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in the streetes, hee would haue imagined that the Author
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7863:41"/> of them had either heard some supreame Magistrate in his time, deepely protesting his resolution for righting the poore, or else had beene most intimately acquainted with the integritie of his proceedings in matters of Iustice, that hee durst so confidently auouch vnto the world on his behalfe; <hi>Psalme</hi> 9. <hi>verse</hi> 8. <hi>He shall iudge the world in righteousnesse, and the people with equitie.</hi> Verse 9. <hi>The Lord also will bee a refuge for the poore, a refuge in due time, euen in affliction.</hi> Verse 10. <hi>And they that know thy Name, will trust in thee: for thou Lord hast not fayled them that seeke thee.</hi> So liuely was <hi>Dauids,</hi> and other ancient Psalmists experience of the Inuisible Gods assistance alwayes readie, aswell in warre as in peace, as well in executing iudgement vpon their treacherous, deceitfull, or secret enemies, as in giuing them victorie ouer their profest and potent foes.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 But posteritie had not often times so full experience of the same assistance, as appeareth from the manner of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. The reason of this Diuersitie, in the auncient and latter Psalmists apprehension of GODS fauour; eyther in deliuering them from daunger, or righting them from wrong; was from the Diuersitie of Times, the later not yeelding so manifest and frequent Documents of GODS mercie or iustice, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had done. As Gods plagues vppon the auncient Israelites were oft times sodaine, and (for the time) violent: so their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from them was speedie, because their stubbornenesse was lesse, and the sinnes, for which they were to repent, of lesse continuance. But the continuall increase of this peoples wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, in their successions, and Posterities slackenesse, in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing either for theyr owne or Predecessours sinnes, made Gods plagues inflicted vppon them more durable, as appeareth by the long captiuities and oppressions of this people in later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if wee compare them with the often, but short afflictions, which in former times had befallen them. This long duraunce of great calamities, made Posteritie lesse apprehensiue of Gods promises than theyr Forefathers had beene; at the least whiles these continued, they were lesse acquainted with Gods fauour than their Predecessours were. And from the want of like sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience of his present helpe in the time of trouble, of later
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7863:42"/> generations are more querulous and lesse confident in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vttered in their distresse, as wee may see in the foure score and eighteenth and other Psalmes, conceiued by the godlie amongest this people in the calamities of later Times. Thus wee may see how truely the diuersitie of Gods dealing with his people in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ages, is represented in the Character, Stile, or Affection of these sacred Writers, all much different in former and later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: much more may wee presume, that the generall and true Diuersitie of Times, and GODS diuers manner of proceeding with mankinde in their seuerall Generations, is most truely rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and exemplified in the Historicall relations of the same sacred Volumes; of which in the Section following.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 Thus much of Experiments, or Obseruations drawne from the Character, or tenor of these sacred Writings themselues, or their Writers affections represented in them. These I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, not that I can hope to perswade any man so much by reading them, as by occasioning him to obserue the like, whiles hee readeth these sacred Volumes. For euerie man that readeth them with attentiue Obseruation, may apprehend much more for the framing of true beliefe in his owne heart, than hee can expresse to others: yea, to seeke to make full resemblance of our inward beliefe, or such Experiments as confirme it, by outward discourse, were all one, as if a man out of the slight impression or transitorie representation of his owne face which hee had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld in a Glasse, should seeke to describe it as fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to an other mans apprehension, as if he had looked vpon it with him in the same Glasse.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 As the representation of our bodily shape, is liuely and perfect whilest wee beholde it in a true and perfect Glasse; but the memoriall or phantasie of it when wee are gone thence, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and dull: So is the apprehension of our owne, or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others beliefe, sensible and fresh, whilest we set our harts and mindes vnto this perfect Lawe of Libertie, the onely true Glasse of our Soules; but more hard to retaine in memorie, or to bee fully represented to an other by Discourse, than our bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shape is by a bare description. And as in the Arte of Painting, generall rules may bee giuen for the right drawing of Pictures, yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7863:42"/> he that will take any particular mans, must looke vppon the liue face it selfe, or vse the benefite of his Glasse: So in this case, there may bee good directions giuen, how men should drawe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or take Obseruations of this kinde, which being taken, can not bee fully imprinted in an other, by him that tooke them: but euerie man must haue continuall recourse vnto this Spirituall Glasse, which farre surpasseth all bodily Glasses in this; that in it wee may see, not onely the true shape and proportion of our Soules as they are, or of what fashion they should be; but it hath also an operatiue force of assimilating them vnto the patternes of godly and religious mens Soules represented herein, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of transfourming them into the similitude of that Image wherein they were first created. The <hi>Idaea</hi> of Sanctitie and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse contained in this <hi>Spirituall Glasse,</hi> are the causes of our edification in good life and vertue: as the <hi>Idaea</hi> or platforme in the Artificers head, is the cause of the materiall house that is builded by it.</p>

But, besides all these, if euery man according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or skill in those arts and faculties which this ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter handles, should vpon due examination of his conclusions or discourse finde resolution in such points as he had alwayes waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in before; or be instructed in matters of his profession or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, whereof he was formerly ignorant: this would much strengthen his assent vnto the former reports or traditions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Author, or vnto the due praises and titles prefixed to his workes; albeit he that made this triall, could not proue the same truth so fully to another, nor cause him to beleeue it so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he himselfe doth, vnlesse he could induce him to examine his writings by like experiments, in some facultie wherein the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had some, though lesse, skill.

Now we haue more certaine experiments to proue that the Scriptures are the word of God, than we can haue to proue any mens workes to be their supposed Authors: for one Author in any Age may be as good as an other; he perhaps better, of whome we haue heard lesse.

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That Heathenish fables ought not to preiudice diuine Truth.</head>
                           <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing more vsuall to men, wise ynough in their generation, than for the varietie or multitude of false reports concerning any subiect, to discredit all that are extant of the same. And all inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto diffidence or distrust is not alwayes to be misliked; but onely when it swayes too farre, or extends it selfe beyond the limits of it proper circumference, that is, matters of bargaine or secular commerce. As this diffident temper is most common in the cunning managers of such affaires: so the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or propension to it were not much amisse in them, did they not <hi>transcendere à genere ad genus;</hi> that is, were not their mistrust commonly too generally rigid and stiffe. For most men of great dealings in the world, finding many slipperie companions, hold it no sinne to be at the least suspitious of all: others, being often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened by such as haue had the name and reputation of honest men, begin to doubt whether there be any such thing indeed, as that which men call honestie; and from this doubting about the reall nature of honestie in the abstract, they resolue vndoubtedly, That if any man in these dayes doe not deale ill with others, it is onely for want of fit oportunitie to doe himselfe any great good. But as facilitie in yeelding assent, vnlesse it be moderated by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7863:44"/> is an infallible consequent of too great simplicitie, and layes a man open to abuse and wrong in matters of this life: so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall mistrust is the certaine fore-runner of infidelitie, and makes a man apt ynough to cousin himselfe, without a tempter, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the life to come; though otherwise this is the very dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which the great Tempter workes most vpon: who for this reason, when any notable truth of greater moment falls out, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by all meanes to fill the world with reports of like euents, but such as vpon examination he foresees will proue false: for hee knowes well, that the beleefe of most pregnant truthes may by this meanes be much impaired, as honest men are vsually mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted when the world is full of knaues. And, to speake the truth, it is but a very short cut betwixt generall and rigid mistrust in worldly dealings, and infidelitie in spirituall matters; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is but a kind of diffidence or mistrust: and he that from the experience of often cousenage comes once to this point, That he will trust none in worldly affaires but vpon strong securitie or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall assurance, may easily be transported by the varietie or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of reports, in spirituall matters, notoriously false, to beleeue nothing but vpon the sure pledge and euidence of his owne sense or naturall reason. This is one maine fountaine of Atheisme; of which (God willing) in the Article of the Godhead. In this place I onely desire to giue the Reader notice of Sathans policie, and to aduertise him withall, that as there is a kind of ingenuous simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, which if it maketh with sobrietie and serious meditation, doth prepare our hearts to Christian beleefe: so there is a kind of suspition by which we may out-reach the old Serpent in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, and preuent his former method of deceit. So, whilest wee read or heare varietie of reports concerning any notable euent, or many Writers beating about one matter, euery one of which may seeme vnprobable in particular circumstances, or else their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie such as makes them incompatible; we should be iealous, that there were some notable truth, whose beleefe did concerne vs, which Sathan hath sought to disparage by the mixture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grosse improbable fruitlesse fables, or else of dissonant probabilities.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Truth is the life and nutriment of the world, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the Veines or Vessels wherein it is contained; which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7863:44"/> straight corrupts and putrifies, vnlesse it be preserued in them, as in it proper receptacles, as both the fabulous conceits of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and foolish practises of the Romish Church in many points may witnesse. But as from Asphaltites, or the dead sea, we may finde out the pleasant streames and fresh springs of Iordan: so from the degenerate and corrupted rellish of decayed truth, which is frequent in the puddle and standing lakes of Heathen Writers, we may be led into the pure fountaine of truth contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in these sacred volumes of Scripture.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 The experiments, which now wee seeke or would occasion others (chiefely young students) to obserue, are such as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did guesse at, or men out of the workes of nature, by reading of Poets, or auncient Writers, may yet doubt of; whereas the true resolution of them onely depends vpon the truth set downe in Scripture.</p>

And as nothing comes into a mans fancie by night in dreames, but the parts or matters of it haue bin formerly in his outward senses (for euen when we dreame of gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mountaines or Chymeraes, the seuerall ingredients haue a reall and sensible truth in them; onely the frame or proportion is such, as hath no sensible example in the workes of nature:) so in auncient Poemes, which were not made in imitation of former, as pictures drawne from pictures, but immediately deuised (as wee now suppose) from the sensible experiments of those times (as pictures drawne from a liuing face) many parts and limmes haue a reall and sensible truth, onely the composition or frame is artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and fained, such as cannot perhaps be paralelled in euery cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, with any reall euents in the course of times.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7863:45"/> the euents (which the most auncient Poets relate) through long distance of time, seeme most strange to vs, yet is the ground of their deuises (especially) such, as vpon better search may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be referred to some Historicall truth, which yeelded stuffe to Poeticall structure, as dayes spectacles doe vnto nights visions. This <hi>Aristotle</hi> had obserued out of the practise of the best aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poets, and prescribes it as a rule to Poets, to haue alwayes an Historicall truth for their ground. Nor durst the Poets haue been so audacious in their fictions at the first, seeing their profession was but either to imitate nature, or adorne a knowne truth; not to disparage any truth by prodigious or monstrous fictions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ground of like experience.

                           <p n="3">3 These allegations sufficiently proue, that night-dreames and visions were frequent, and their obseruation (if taken in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie) to good vse, in auncient times, euen amongst the nations, vntill they forgot,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.8.</note> as <hi>Ioseph</hi> said, <hi>That interpretations were from God,</hi> and sought to find out an art of interpreting them: Then night-visions did either cease, or were so mixt with delusions, that they could not be discerned; or, if their euents were in some sort fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene, yet men being ignorant of Gods prouidence, commonly made choise of such meanes for their auoidance, as proued the necessarie occasions or prouocations of the euents they feared.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Much better was the temper of the Nations before <hi>Homers</hi> time: They, amongst other kindes of Prophecyings and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayings, held dreames and their interpretations (as all other good gifts) to be from God; as no euill was done in the Grecian campe, which the gods, in their opinion, did not cause.

                              <hi>that such as liued chastly and vprightly should be inspired with true visions by night, and such men, it was meete, should consult the Diuine Powers in the Temple by night-visions: but others, who were not so well minded, ought not to intrude themselues into this sacred businesse; or, if they would, they were to expect no true visions, but illusions or idle dreames;</hi> from God they were not to expect any. Yet may it not be denied, but that the Heathens were oft times, by Gods permission, truly resolued by Dreames or Oracles (though ministred by diuels) of euents that should come; but seldome were such resolutions for their good: So the Witch which <hi>Saul</hi> most Heathen-like consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when God had cast him off, did procure him a true prediction of his fearefull end. This is a point wherein I could be large; but I will conclude. As the Heathens relations of sundrie euents vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in auncient times, confirme the truth of the like, recorded in Scripture; so the Scriptures giue the true causes of their being, ceasing, or alteration: which the corrupt and polypragmaticall disposition of later ages, without reuelation from the cause of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and disposer of times, could neuer haue dreamed of; as may partly appeare from what hath beene said of Dreames, more fully from that which followes next of Oracles.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue often and daily occasion (for the satisfaction of my mind in sundrie questions that might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise haue vext me) to thanke my God, that as he made me a reasonable creature, and of a reasonable creature a student or contemplator, so he did not make me a meere Philosopher: (though <hi>Plato</hi> thought this deserued the greatest thankes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatest benefit bestowed vpon him by his God) but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was I more incited in this respect to blesse the day wherein I was made a Christian, than when I read <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Tract of the causes why Oracles ceased in his time. Whether Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were all illusions of diuels, or some vttered by God himselfe for their good (though oft times without successe, by reason of their curiositie and superstition) I now dispute not. That Oracles in auncient times had beene frequent; that such euents had been foretold by them, as surpassed the skill of humane reason: all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of vnpartiall antiquitie beare vncontrollable euidence. Nor did the Heathen Philosophers themselues, which liued in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges immediately following their decay, call the truth of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vse in question: but from admiration of this knowne change, they were incited to search the cause of their ceasing.<note place="margin">Lib. de Defectu oraculorum.</note>
                              <hi>Plutarch,</hi> after his acute search of sundrie causes &amp; accurate Philosophicall disputes, referres it partly vnto the absence of his daemoniacall spirits, which by his Philosophie might dye or flit from place to place, either exiled by others more potent, or vpon some other dislike; and partly vnto the alteration of the soyle, wherein Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were seated, which yeelded not exhalations of such a diuine temper as in former times it had done; and without a certaine temperature of exhalations or breathing of the earth, the daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall spirits (hee thought) could not giue their Oracles, more than a Musitian can play without an Instrument. And this decay or alteration of the soyle of Delphi, and like places, was (in his iudgement) probable, from the like knowne experience in sundry Riuers, Lakes, and hot-Baths; which, in some places, did quite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7863:48"/> drie vp and vanish; in others, much decay for a long time, or change their course; and yet afterwards recouer their former course or strength, either in the same places, or some neere adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Thus he expected Oracles should either come in vse againe in Greece, or else burst out in some more conuenient soyle. The Atheists of this age (our English home-bred ones at least) haue altogether as great reason to denie the decay or drying vp of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and Lakes, as to suspect the frequencie of Oracles, or other euents in times past: for neither they nor their fathers haue had any more experience of the one than of the other. <hi>Plutarchs</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie (amongst many others) is authentike for the vse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Oracles: but neither his authoritie, nor the reasons which he brings, can giue satisfaction to any man that seekes the true cause of their defect. He referres it (indeed) in a generalitie to the gods; not that they wanted good will to mankind still, but that the matter did decay which their ministers (the daemonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirits) did worke vpon, as you heard before. Wee may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sure grounds with confidence affirme, That euen this decay of matter, which he dreames of (had it conferred ought to the vse of Oracles) was from God. And <hi>he</hi> (as the Psalmist speakes) <hi>that turneth the flouds into a Wildernesse, and dryeth vp the water Springs, and maketh a fruitfull land barren, for the iniquitie of them that dwell therein,</hi> did also bring, not onely the Oracle of Delphi, so much frequented amongst the Grecians, but all other kinds of diuinations, vsed amongst his owne people in the old world, to desolation: and by pouring out his spirit more plenteously vpon the barren hearts of vs Heathen, hath filled the barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe with better store of riuers of comfort than the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Israel, his owne inheritance, had euer knowne. Or if wee desire a more immediate cause of these Oracles defect amongst the Heathens; the time was come,<note place="margin">

                           <p n="2">2 <hi>Plutarchs</hi> relation of his daemoniacall spirits mourning for great <hi>Pans</hi> death, about this time, is so strange, that it might perhaps seeme a tale, vnlesse the truth of the common bruite had beene so constantly auouched by eare-witnesses vnto <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                              <pb n="50" facs="tcp:7863:49"/> that it made him call a conuocation of Wisemen, as <hi>Herod</hi> did at our Sauiours birth, to resolue him who this great <hi>Pan,</hi> late deceased, should be. <hi>Thamus,</hi> the Aegyptian Master, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne by that name to his passengers, vntill he answered to it at the third call of an vncouth voice, vttered <hi>(sine authore)</hi> from the land, requesting him to proclaime the newes of great <hi>Pans</hi> death, as he passed by Palodes, was resolued to haue let all passe as a fansie or idle message, if the winde and tide should graunt him passage by the place appointed: but, the wind fayling him on a suddaine, at his comming thither, he thought it but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle losse of breath to crie out aloud vnto the shoare, as hee had beene requested, <hi>Great Pan is dead.</hi> The words, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, were scarce out of his mouth, before they were answered with a huge noyse, as it had beene of a multitude, sighing and groaning at this wonderment. If these spirits had beene by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mortall, as this Philosopher thinkes, the death of their chiefe Captaine could not haue seemed so strange: but that a farre greater than the greatest of them, by whose power the first of them had his being, should die to redeeme his enemies from their thraldome, might well feeme a matter of wonderment and sorrow vnto them. The circumstance of the time will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to doubt, but that vnder the knowne name of <hi>Pan</hi> was intimated the great Shepheard of our soules, that had then layd downe his life for his flocke; not the fained sonne of <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Penelope,</hi>

For it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by sufficient testimonies, in their due time and place to be produced, that sundry generall, confused, or aenigmaticall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Sauiours conception, birth, and Pastorall office, had beene spread abroad amongst the Nations. Hence, in stead of him, they frame a <hi>Pan,</hi> the God of Shepheards; in stead of the holy Spirit, by whom he was to be conceiued, they haue a <hi>Mercurie</hi> (their false God, fained Messenger and Interpreter) for <hi>Pans</hi> father; in stead of the blessed Virgine, who was to beare our Sauiour, they haue a <hi>Penelope</hi> for their young Gods mother.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7863:49"/> The affinitie of qualitie and offices, in all the parties here para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled, made this transfiguration of diuine Truth easie vnto the Heathen; and the manner of it cannot seeme improbable to vs, if we consider the wonted vanitie of their imaginations, in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the glorie of the immortall Godhead into the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of earthly thinges, most dislike to it in nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thus admitting <hi>Plutarchs</hi> storie to be most true, it no way proues his intended conclusion, that the wilde goatish <hi>Pan</hi> was mortall: but the Scriptures set foorth vnto vs the true cause, why both he, and all the rest of that hellish crue should at that time howle and mourne, seeing by the great Shepheards death they were become dead in law; no more to breath in Oracles, but quite to be depriued of all such strange motions, as they had seduced the ignorant world with before. All the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke trickes of <hi>Faunus,</hi> the Satyres, and such like creatures, were now put downe; God had resolued to make a translation of his Church; and for this cause the Diuels were enforced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue their old Chappels, and seeke a new forme of their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or Seruice. Whilest the Israelites were commaunded to consult with Gods Priests, Prophets, or other Oracles, before they vndertooke any difficult warre or matters of moment, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than had his Priests and Oracles as much frequented by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Princes vpon the like occasions. So <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth,<note place="margin">Lib. citato.</note> That the auncient Heathen, in their chiefe consultations of State, did relye more vpon Oracles than humane policie. If <hi>Moses</hi> were fortie dayes in the Mount, to receiue Lawes from Gods owne mouth, <hi>Minos</hi> will be <hi>Iupiters</hi> Auditor,<note place="margin">Plato in Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In emulation of Shiloh, or Kireath-jearim, whilest the Arke of God remained there; the Heathens had Dodona; and for Ierusalem they had Delphi, garnished with rich donatiues of forraine Princes as well as Grecians; so magnified also by Grecian Writers, as if it had beene the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded paralell of the holy Citie. Insomuch,<note place="margin">Plut. ibid.</note> that <hi>Plutarch</hi> thinkes the storie, commonly receiued of that Oracles originall, to be lesse probable, because it ascribes the inuention of it to chaunce, and not to the diuine prouidence, or fauour of the Gods: when as it had beene such a direction vnto Greece, in vndertaking
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7863:50"/> warres, in building Cities, and in time of pestilence and famine. Whether these effects in auncient times had beene alwayes from the information of Diuels (as I said before) I will not dispute. That this Oracle had beene often consulted, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and that oftentimes the Diuels deluded such as consulted them, is as manifest. But since that saying of the Prophet was fulfilled,<note place="margin">Ier. 31.33.</note>
                              <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> since the knowledge of Truth hath beene so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously made knowne and reuealed, and the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion so much dilated and enlarged by discourse, the Diuell hath chosen prowd hearts and busie braines for his Oracles; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by their subtiltie of wit, and plausibilitie of discourse, to counterfeit and corrupt the forme of wholesome Doctrine; as he did of old, the truth of Gods visible Oracles, by his apish imitations.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 This conclusion then is euident, both from the ioynt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of all auncient Writers, as well prophane, as sacred; That God in former times had spoken vnto the world by Dreames, Visions, Oracles, Priests, and Prophets; and that such reuelations had beene, amongst the Israelites, as the Starres or Night-lampes; amongst the Heathen as Meteors, fierie Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, or wandering Comets, for their direction in the time of darkenesse and ignorance. But when both the sensible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our times, and the relations of former ages, most vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in this case, haue sufficiently declared vnto vs, That all the former twinckling lights are vanished; the reason of this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I see, men might seeke by naturall causes, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> did. But this doubt is cleared, and the question truely resolued by our Apostle in these wordes:<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.</note>
                              <hi>At sundrie times, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse manners, God spake in the old time to our Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his Sonne, whom he hath made heire of all thinges, by whom also he made the world:</hi> who, <hi>being</hi> (as the Apostle there sayth) <hi>the brightnesse of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> hath put the former lights, which shined in darkenesse, to flight. The consideration hereof confirmes that truth of our Apostle to all such as are not blinded in heart, where he sayth, That <hi>the night was past, and the day was come:</hi> For the suddaine
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7863:50"/> vanishing of all former lights, about this time assigned by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of our Sauiours birth, abundantly euince, That this was the <hi>Sunne of Righteousnesse which</hi> (as the Prophet had foretold) <hi>should arise vnto the world.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.2.</note> It was the Light which had lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Coasts of Iurie, then approaching Italie, Greece, and other of these Westerne Countries, which did cause these sonnes of darkenesse (the daemoniacall Spirits) to flit West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as Darkenesse it selfe doth from the face of the Sunne, when it beginnes to appeare in the East. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells vs,<note place="margin">Plut. ibid.</note> That after they had forsaken the Countrey of Greece, they haunted little desart Islands, neere adjoyning to the coasts of this our Britanie; where they raysed such hideous stormes and tempests, as Nauigators report they haue done of late in that Island, called by their owne name. Both reports had their times of truth; and the like may be yet true, in some places, more remote from commerce of Christians. But the Heathen (as Heathenish minded men doe euen to this day) sought the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of such alterations from sensible Agents, or second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which haue small affinitie with those effects: or if they had, yet the disposition of such causes depends wholly vpon his will; who, though most immutable in himselfe, changeth times and seasons at his pleasure. And wheresoeuer the light of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell commeth, it verifieth that saying of our Apostle, <hi>Ecce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera transierunt, &amp; noua facta sunt omnia:</hi> And new times yeeld new obseruations; which cannot be taken aright, nor their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses knowne, without especiall directions from this rule of Life. By which it plainely appeareth, that the second maine period of the World, since the Floud (whose beginning wee account from the promulgation of the Law, and the distinction of the Israelites from other people, vntill the time of Grace) yeeldes great alteration and matter of much different obseruation from the former. And in the declining, or later part of this second age, wee haue described vnto vs, as it were, an ebbe or staunch in the affaires of the Kingdome of Israel, going before the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fullnesse of time: After which wee see the tenure of all thinges in Iurie, and of other Kingdomes of the world, quite changed. But the particulars of this change I intend to handle
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7863:51"/> hereafter: I now would prosecute my former obseruations of the old world.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 Continually, whilest we compare ancient Poets or stories with the booke of Genesis, and other volumes of sacred Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: these sacred bookes giue vs the patterne of the waking thoughts of ancient times; and the Heathen Poems, with other fragments of Ethnike writings (whose entire bodies, though not so aged as the former, being but the workes of men, haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished) containe the dreames and fancies which succeeding ages by heare-say, and broken reports, had conceiued, concerning the same or like matters: So no doubt had God disposed, that the delight which men tooke in the vncertaine glimpse of truth in the one, should enure their mindes the better to obserue the light which shineth in the other; and that the vnstable varietie of the one should prepare mens hearts more stedfastly to imbrace the truth and stabilitie of the other, when it should be reuealed vnto them. And, as any man almost, if hee bee obseruant of his former actions, cogitations, and occurrents, may finde out the occasion how dreames (though in themselues oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, absurd, and foolish) come into his braine or fancie: so may any iudicious man, from the continuall and serious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of this Register of truth, finde out the originall, at least, of all the principall heads or common places of Poeticall fictions or ancient Traditions, which cannot be imagined they should euer haue come into any mans fancie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse from the imitation of some Historicall truth, or the impulsion of reall euents stirring vp admiration. For admiration (as shall afterward appeare) did breede, and imitation spoile, the diuine art of Poetrie.</p>

That the like inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finds some acceptation now, it is, because mens mindes haue beene possessed with this conceit from the tradition of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers. For many inuentions, which in succession cease to be of like vse and consequence as they were in former times, become yet matters of delight and sport vnto posteritie: as Shooting continues still an Exercise of good recreation to vs of this Land, because it hath beene a practise of admirable vse and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence vnto our worthie auncestors.

How became it a common place of Poeticall inuention, whilest Poetrie it selfe was but beginning? Surely, as God had spoken in diuerse manners vnto the old world, so had he appeared in diuerse formes (perhaps) not onely to the Israelites, but vnto other nations also before the distinction of this people from them: howsoeuer, as the diuels had counterfeited Gods manner of speaking to his people, so did they the manner of his, or his Angels apparitions.</p>

                           <p n="3">3 As the end and purpose which <hi>Homer</hi> assignes for these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of his gods; so are both these, and many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumstances of his gods assisting the ancient heroickes, such as might iustly breed offence to any serious reader, if a man should auouch them in earnest, or seeke to perswade him to expect more than meere delight in them. Yet I can not thinke, that he would haue fained such an assistance, vnlesse the valour of some men, in former times, had beene extraordinarie, and more than naturall. Which supernaturall excellencie in some, before others, could not proceede but from a supernaturall cause. And thus farre his conceit agrees with Scripture: that there were more heroicall spirits in olde times, than in later, and more immediate directions from God, for managing of most warres. And from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereof, the auncient Poets are more copious in their hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall praises of their Worthies, than the discreeter sort of later Poets durst be, whilest they wrote of their owne times. Not that the auncient were more licentious, or lesse obseruant of decorum in this kinde of fiction, than the other: but because the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Diuine power in many of their victories, was more seen in ancient, than in later times: so that such fictions, as to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people might seem, by reason of these extraordinarie euents, then frequent, very probable; would haue beene censured as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and apish in succeeding Ages, wherein no like euents were manifested. The like extraordinarie manifestation of Gods power in battell, and of this heroicall valour inspired into men, we see most frequent in the auncient Stories of the Bible, as in the bookes of <hi>Moses, Iosuah, Iudges, Samuel:</hi> some one man in those times, was worth a thousand others: but in the Histories of the later Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> such extraordinarie heroical spirits are very rare. One or two miraculous victories <hi>Israel</hi> had in <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shahs,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> time: but by the power, of Angells: no extraordinarie valour of anie man was much seene in them. And, these few excepted, their battels, their victories, and maner of fight, come neere vnto the nature of other nations in the same time. Generally from <hi>Rehoboams</hi> time, the Histories of <hi>Iudah</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7863:53"/>
                              <hi>Israel</hi> fall much more within the compasse of moderne and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie obseruation, than did the euents of former Ages. And if we had any perfect register of such matters as had fallen out in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations and kingdomes during the time of <hi>Moses, Iosuah,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges:</hi> wee should finde them much more consonant to the sacred Stories of these times, than are any Histories of later times, or of former ages, wherein any Historiographer of better account did liue. And albeit I can not excuse <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Ctesias,</hi> either from affecting fabulous narrations, or too great facilitie in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the superstitious report or hearesay-traditions of others: yet is mens mistrust of them vsually more vniuersall, than in scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastike discretion and obseruation it neede to be; onely because the like euents haue not beene vsuall in any Age throughout these parts of the world, since the times whereof they wrote. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if many since that time suspect the signes and wonders of the old world, when as the Psalmist, that liued before most heathen Writers that are extant (besides such as relate like strange euents) complaines; <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.9. <hi>We see not our signes, there is not one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet more.</hi> Generally, after <hi>Iudah</hi> had beene captiued by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that and other kingdomes lie, as it were, vnder one paralel, and may almost be measured by the same line: the eleuation of the Iew and Gentile is much-what the same, and the same celestiall obseruation may serue for both. The Priests after their returne from captiuitie, were forbidden to eate of the most holy thing, till there arose vp a Priest with <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, Ezra</hi> 2.63. But; either no such did arise at all, from the erection of the second tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vntill Christs time: or, if any did, it was but to giue this people a farewell of Gods extraordinarie speaking vnto them, either by Priests or Prophets.<note place="margin">Antiquitatum. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>

But more probable is the opinion of others, that this, as all other kind of Prophecies, and many extraordinary signes of Gods power and presence (sometime most frequent in that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) did cease with that generation which returned from captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or immediately after the finishing of the second temple: as if God during all that time, had appoynted a Fast or Vigil, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the time of fulnesse, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28.

As God, elsewhere, had threatned, so it came to passe, that visions had ceased in <hi>Iudah,</hi> before the rising of the Romane Empire: and likely it is that presages by dreames, or like meanes, formerly vsuall among the Ancient heathen, did either altogether determine, or much decrease in many Nations about the same time. For which reasons, the Romans of that Age, being the onely wise men of the world (giuen too much by nature vnto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular policie:) did giue lesse credite to the relations of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greekes, or the euents registred by their Auncestours in their owne Countrey. The like incredulitie remaineth in most of vs: but may be easily remoued by discouering the root of it.</p>

                           <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the common practise of men to measure matters of Ancient times, by obseruation of the times and place wherein they liue: as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee passe our censure on other mens actions and intentions, according to our owne resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and secret purposes in like cases. And, besides this generall occasion of mistaking other mens actions, and euents of other times, euery particular sort of men seek to assigne causes of things sutable vnto their proper faculties. The naturall Philosopher stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to reduce all effects to the matter and forme, or some other sensible quality; the Mathematician, to abstract formes or figures
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7863:54"/> or insensible influences; the Politician thinks no alteration in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like States, or priuate mens affaires, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>lles out, but from some po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike cause or purpose of man: and whilest in the Annales of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities hee reades of sundrie euents, surpassing the reach or skill of mans inuention, or contrarie to the ordinary course of nature, hee attributes all vnto the simplicitie or credulitie of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. Albeit, if we should search the true cause of their credulitie in yeelding assent vnto such strange reports, it will easily confute the error of posteritie: for this credulitie in such particulars, could not haue beene so great in their Ancestors, vnlesse their mindes had beene first inclined to the generall, from the tradition of their Predecessors. But why their forefathers should either haue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such strange reports, or be so inclinable to beleeue them: if we search into the depth or first spring of this perswasion, we cannot imagine any other cause, but the reall and sensible experience of such strange euents as they reported to posterity. This did inforce beliefe vpon the first Progenitors of any Nation: and from the fulnesse of this perswasion, or actuall beliefe in them, was bred this credulitie or aptnesse in posteritie, to beleeue the like, which yet in successe of time did by little and little weare out. It is great simplicitie and vncharitable credulitie in vs, to thinke, that either the most Ancient, or middle Ages of the world, were generally so simple, credulous, or apt to beleeue euery thing, as some would make them. It had beene as hard a matter to haue perswaded men of these times, that there were no Gods, no diuine power or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: as it would be to perswade the moderne Atheists, that there is an Almightie power, which created all things; gouerneth and disposeth all things to his glorie. The most politike Atheist now aliue, is as credulous in his kinde, as the simplest creature in the old world was: and will yeeld his assent vnto the Epicures or other brutish Philosophers conclusions, vpon as light reasons, as they did their beliefe vnto any fable concerning the power or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the Gods: the reason of both their credulities in two contrarie kinds, is the same. The often manifestation of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary power in battels, or presence in oracles, and sensible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of reuenge from heauen, made the one prone to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any report of the Gods, though neuer so strange: &amp; the want of like sensible signes or documēts of the same power in our daies
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7863:54"/> (whilest all mens minds are still set on politike meanes and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for their owne good,) doth make the other so credulous and apt to assent vnto any politike Discourse, and so auerse from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the Prophets or sacred Writers, which reduce al effects to the first cause. But this we can not doe so immediately as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient did: because God vseth his wisedome more in the managing of this politike world, than he did in times of old; and men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are lesse apprehensiue of his wisedome, than of his power; so that his present wayes are not so obuious at the first sight vnto sense as sometimes they were, though more conspicuous to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified reason now at this day than before, and the manner of his proceeding more apt to confirme true beliefe in such as follow his prescripts, than euer it was. For the same reason were the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Israelites more prone to idolatrie, than their successours were, after the erection of the second Temple; or eyther of them were at any time to serue their GOD. For the sensible signes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching inticements of some extraordinarie powers, mistaken for Diuine, were then most common; and Gods wonders and miracles grew more rare, because they swarued from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. What Iew was there, almost, in the time of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> but would haue giuen his body for an Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caustum, rather than sacrifice to any of the heathen Gods? The vndoubted experience of long woe and miserie for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer idolatrie, made them so auerse from this sinne; and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine signes of the Messiahs approach, did support them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Atheisme. Such violence as these later willingly suffered at the hands of heathen Princes, rather than they would consent vnto idolatrie, their forefathers in the wildernesse were as readie to offer vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> for not furthering them in their idolatrous i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations So we reade <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. when God had but for a while withdrawne his extraordinarie presence from them, &amp; <hi>Moses</hi> his instrument in working myracles, had bin but a short time out of their sight: they complaine he taried long, <hi>and gathered themselues together against</hi> Aaron, <hi>and said vnto him; Vp, and make vs Gods to goe before vs: for of this</hi> Moses, <hi>the man that brought vs out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</hi> There was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lest they should turne Atheists, this was a sinne vnknowne in that age. And this people had experience enough of extraordinary
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7863:55"/> powers in Egypt, which they took for Gods. So far are they from thinking there was no god that guides the world, that they thoght there were many: and if one did withdraw his presence, an other might serue to conduct them: one they must haue, otherwise all help of man was in vaine. As <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> had withstoode <hi>Moses</hi> miracles with their magick; so had the diuels, their masters, sought to work wonders about the Egyptian idols, which did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stupifie the people. For albeit their wonders were not so great, as gods: yet were they more delightfull to their outward sense; for their seruice for the most part, was sport and play. They were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer daintie to shew their iugling tricks, for their owne aduantage; alwaies pliable to the humors &amp; lusts of men: whereas the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent maiestie of God would haue all to frame their liues &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to his written Laws, which might not be altered or mis-interpreted, at the pleasure of men; nor would he vouchsafe to worke his miracles in all ages, or vnto such as were vnworthie spectators of them. Thus had Satan his oracles and sacrifices oft times better frequented, than God had his; as in these times, such Preachers as will accommodate themselues vnto the peoples hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, are most frequented, but such as hold this sinne as sacrilege and dishonour to their God, are despised and set at naught. And though we may not mitigate <hi>Aarons</hi> fault, nor diminish these Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites transgression (as their foolish posterity doth) by transferring the blame of this idolatrous fact vpon the Magicians which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the host of Israell out of Egypt: yet it is more than probable from the circumstance of the Text (besides the tradition of the ancient Hebrews,) that there was some magicall or daemoniacall skill practised in the sodain moulting of this Egiptiā god, whence this peoples superstition towards it was increased.<note place="margin">Plutarch. de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta oraculor. pag. <hi>742.</hi> edit. H. Steph.</note> The heathen princes of those times were no babies; as wary (we may presume) vpon what occasion to forgoe their children, as misers are to part with mony: &amp; yet these were wrested from them, and their blood shed by their owne hands, to pacifie the rage of powers, then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly knowne for supernatural. But when both Gods wonders grew rare, and the diuells trickes waxed scant, either by restraint from aboue, or of their owne free choice, as if by their long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance they had growne out of request: they see it more boote to draw the politike world vnto Atheisme, which neuer did florish
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7863:55"/> vntill the rising of the Roman monarchie. Vnto this maine incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of the late Romans, and other worldly wise mens distrust of wonders past, this second mischiefe did accrew, That sundry Writers of those times, did hold it a part of their profession, to fill their bookes with such stuffe, as they found in ancient stories; as if their Histories or Poems had not been currant, without as many parts or heads of inuention, as others had in former Ages. And this experience of counterfeit wonders, meeting with the want of experience of anie true wonders of that time, did concurre as the forme and priuation for the producing of infidelitie in mens minds already disposed to this euill by secular policie. And these were enough to carry our mindes below the lowest degree of any credulitie, or suspition of truth, in like reports: vnlesse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did forewarne vs of this guile and policie of Satan, which we may the better preuent, if we diligently obserue, first, the difference of times and places; secondly, how strange fables and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders receiue being from notable and admirable decayed truths, as baser Creatures doe life, from the dissolution of more noble bodies.</p>

And we haue altogether as litle reason to enuy either the generall truth of strange euents recorded by the auncient, or the prototypos of poeticall inuentions in former times, for the want of like experience in later: as we haue to discredit <hi>Benzos</hi> martyrs, or other late nauigators obseruations of the East or West Indies,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7863:56"/> because many, who haue trauelled France, Spaine, and Italy, while they make true relatiōs of their trauels, relate no such euent, as the Indies afford many. And yet Gulles, when they flie abroad, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late (amongst such as know them not) as strange matters of neare adioyning countries, as he that had compassed the vtmost endes of the world. Now it were a great folly to discredit all late naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators, for the absurditie of some few Gulles: and as great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it were to disparage all ancient stories, for the absurd &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous imitation of later writers, against all experience of later times. For diuersitie of times yeelds as great diuersitie of obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the diuersitie or distance of place; onely this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Daily obseruation yeeldes experiments of this diuersitie in place, whereas the word of God alone which indures for euer, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs the sure rules and grounds of alterations in the euents of different ages. And yet in many remote places lately made known vnto the inhabitants of Europe, such strange euents as Antiquity hath told vs, were sometimes frequent in these Countries which wee now inhabite, are not at this day altogether vnusuall. And the face of Time is now there much-what such, as the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters of Times haue pourtrayed vnto vs: as if the affaires and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of this visible world, were framed according to some inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patterns or supercoelestiall Characters; which varying their aspect in reuolutions of time, did now (by reflecting that force vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these remote countries, which they did on these neare adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in times past) produce the like shape &amp; fashion of things there, as they haue done here. And those places shal, in time, com to the selfe same temper &amp; disposition which we now enioy: and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of such as now liue there, shal hereafter suspect the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted stories of our times concerning their ancestors, as we do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ancient stories of Iewry, Syria, Asia, or our owne countries, for want of like moderne experiments in our land.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 For the better rectifying of our assent, which must be by the right balancing of credulity and mistrust, it shall not be amisse to consider, that, besides these general diuersities of times and places, particular kingdomes and nations haue their seueral ages propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to infancie, youth, virilitie, and old age in men: nor is the period either of the whole age, or the seuerall parts thereof, one &amp; the same in all, but varies in diuerse kingdomes, as the course of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7863:56"/> life, or seuerall ages do in diuerse men. Some kingdoms beare age well vnto a thousand; some to sixe hundred yeares: others breake and decay in halfe that time. Againe, as in the course of mans life diuersity of ages requires diuers manners or conditions: so, in the same people or nation, some euents are vsuall, as best befitting them in that degree of their growth which answeres to youth, or infancie, which seldome or neuer fall out in that part of their age which answeres vnto mature or old age in men, because not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for their constitution then; and yet the want of like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes them as distrustfull and incredulous of what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had beene, as old men are forgetfull of their own disposition or temper in youth. Generally, when the fulnesse of any nations ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie (wherein their decrepit age consisteth,) is come, they grow more and more incredulous: so as they verifie the Latine prouerb concerning the disposition of old men: <hi>Nullus senex veneratur Iouem:</hi> more true of states;
<q>
                                 <l>As they grow old,</l>
                                 <l>Their zeale growes cold.</l>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3 As the world was redeemed by Christ, so doe nations begin a new computation of their ages, from their admission to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie. Some were come to youth, or virilitie in their profession, before others were borne in Christ: as Asia and Africa, for the most part, were Christians before Europe. Againe, the ancient inhabitants in some prouinces had beene Christians, long before other people that afterward subdued them and liued in their countries: as the Britaines in this Iland had beene long partakers of Gods mercy in Christ, before the Saxons; and the ancient Gaulles, before the Franks, which afterward seated themselues in their habitations. Generally, miracles were vsuall in the infancie of Christianitie, as we read in Ecclesiasticall stories: nor can it be certainly gathered when they did generally cease. To say they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured no longer than the Pimitiue Church, can giue no vniuersall satisfaction, saue only to such as thinke it enough for all the world to haue the light of the Gospell lockt vp in the Chancell of some one glorious Church: for some Churches were but in the Prime, or Change, when others were full of Christian knowledge. The vse of miracles at the same instant was befitting the one, not the other. For God vsually speakes to new-borne children in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7863:57"/> Christ, by miracles or sensible declarations of his power, mercy, or iustice: as parents deterre their children from euill, in tender yeres, by the rod, or other sensible signes of their displeasure; and assure them to goodnes with apples, or other like visible pledges of their loue: but, when they come to riper yeares, and are capable of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or apprehensiue of wholesome admonitions, they seeke to rule thē by reason. Proportionally to this course of parents doth God speak to his church: in her infancie, (wheresoeuer planted) by sensible documents of his power; in her maturitie, by the ordinarie preaching of his word, which is more apt to ripen &amp; confirm true Christian faith than any miracles are, so men would submit their reason vnto the rules set down in Scripture, and vnpartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all euents of time by them, as elsewhere, God willing, we shall shew.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 These grounds, well considered, will moue any sober spirit at the least to suspend his assent, and not suffer his mind to be hastily ouerswaied with absolute distrust of all such miracles, as either our writers report to haue bin wrought in this our land at the Saxons first comming hither, or the French Historiographers record in the first conuersion of the Franks, or in the prime of that Church.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 And the Franks and Saxons before their conuersion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, were much-what of that temper, in respect of their present posteritie, as Greece was of in <hi>Homers,</hi> or Italy in the daies of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> in respect of <hi>Ciceroes,</hi> or <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time: nor would I denie, but that admonitions by dreames were vsuall amongst them, as they had beene amongst the Easterne nations.</p>

                              </note> of the present state of France: in which the last part of that threefold vision is more truly verified, than it was euer in the lineall succession of <hi>Childerick</hi> and <hi>Bassina,</hi> or any of the <hi>Merouingian,</hi> or <hi>Carlouingian</hi> families.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 The vision was of three sorts of beasts; the first, Lyons &amp; Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards; the second, Beares and wolues; the third, of Dogs or lesser creatures, biting and deuouring one another. The interpretation which <hi>Bassina</hi> made of it, was registred certaine hundred yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go; That these troupes of vermine or lesser creatures, did signifie a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7863:57"/> people without feare or reuerence of their Princes, so pliable and deuoutly obsequious to follow the Peeres or Potentates of that Nation in their factious quarrels, that they should inuolue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in inextricable tumults to their owne destruction.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 Had this vision beene painted, onely with this general noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; that it was to be emblematically vnderstood of some state in Europe: who is he that can discerne a picture by the knowne partie whom it represents, but could haue knowne as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, that this was a mappe of those miseries that lately haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen France; whose bowels were almost rent and torne, with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and domesticke broyles? God grant her closed wounds fall not to bleed a fresh againe, and that her people be not so eagerly set to bite and teare one another (like dogs or other testie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,) vntill all become a prey to Wolues and Beares, or other great rauenous beasts; which seeke not so much to teare or rent in heat of reuenge, as lie in waite continually to deuoure and swallow with vnsatiate greedinesse, the whole bodies of mightie Kingdomes, and to dye her Robes, that rides as Queene of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vpon that many-headed beast, with streames of bloud that issue from the bodies squezed and crushed betweene their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent teeth; yea, euen with the royall bloud of Kings and Princes. Many such examples of admonitions by dreames and other extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary signes of future woe or calamities, both foretold and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled many hundred yeares since <hi>Bassina</hi> and <hi>Childerickes</hi> daies, I could bring, which might confirme the historicall truth of the like mentioned in Scriptures to any ciuill heathen, as they haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced such as we most suspect for Atheists, to acknowledge a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power or prouidence in them. And I know not what reason any professor of truth can haue to denie the like presignifications in later times vpon extraordinarie occasions, or in some trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations of Kingdomes; if he haue so much Religion as not to doubt of <hi>Nabuchadnezers</hi> vision. But of such signes, (whether good, or ominous) and of their lawfull vse elsewhere. Of the vse of prophecies amongst the heathen and barbarous people, and of that offence which some take at such as seem to giue any credit to them, as if this were against the truth of scriptures, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps take occasion to speake, when we come to vnfold the diuers kinds of prophecies amongst the Iewes, with their interpretations.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7863:58"/> Thus much may suffice for the remouall of that preiudice, which Atheists, Infidels, and other worldly-wise men haue, of their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors credulitie, or fabulositie, which were not incident to prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie antiquitie, but vnto ages in succession nearer to those times wherein wonders had beene plentifull: as commonly the bragga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochian humour doth haunt the degenerate race of worthy ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, before their posteritie come to be sneaks or peasants, which in the race of priuate persons answeres in proportion to infidelity, the common symptome of decrepit age in kingdomes.</p>

                           <p n="2">2 A Poet being (as his name imports) a maker, according to the Latine prouerb, is not made by art, but framed to this diuine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie by nature. Not that any amongst the Romans became Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets on a sodaine: but that many very fruitfull wits in all other kinds of learning, could not be forced by any industrie, art, or culture to such a temper, as was befitting this plant of Eden, which groweth not in any moderne breast without more tender care and greater cherishing, than any other slip or branch of the tree of knowledge; and yet when all is done seldome comes to any proofe, vnlesse it borrow grounds from the Ancient: as tender plants can hardly be remoued from a better foile to a worse, without some of the earth wherein they naturally grow. Were arts to begin a-new, Poetrie, which was the first and most common among the Ancient, in all probability, would spring the last, &amp; grow the slowest amongst vs. Their wits of old were not naturally or generally better than ours:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7863:58"/> why then was the way to Pernassus, which vnto vs, vsing all help of art and imitation, is laborious and hard to ascend, so plaine and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to them, without any guide or helpe; all other artificial learning being then either vnknown, or very scant? Such knowledge or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiōs as they had or cared for, they knew not otherwise how to conuey vnto posterity, than by poetical numbers &amp; resemblances. He is a Poet by nature (saith that excellent Poet and diuine Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher) <hi>That is apt to be rauished with the true and natiue beautie of such obiects as are represented to his senses, &amp; can expresse his conceit by such pleasant resemblances, as oftē as he shal haue occasion to vtter his mind in writing or set speech.</hi> This inclination or disposition is as the ground or soile wheron Poetry doth naturally grow, whether in ancient or moderne breasts: but the ancient had this aduantage. The fashion of the world in their times was more apt to rauish their thoughts with admiration: wonderfull euents were then frequent: nor did their frequēcy abate, but rather increase wondermēt, because their varietie was great, &amp; the apprehension of inuisible or supernatural powers in them vsuall. So that admiration was then inforced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, &amp; the breasts of such as diligently obserued these euents, or were any way disposed by nature to the faculty, were inspired with liuely and sublimate affections, apt to vent themselues in such poetical phrase and resemblances, as we cannot reach vnto, vnlesse we raise our inuention by art &amp; imitation, and stirre vp admiration by meditation and studie. And because neither our senses are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with any extraordinary effects of Gods power, nor our minds bent to obserue the waies of his wisdome, so as we might be stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with true admiration of them, we haue fewer good sacred po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emes, than of any other kind. But as the Ancients chiefe learning did consist of Poetry: so the excellency of their Poetrie was chiefly seene in the power and natiue subiect of this faculty, that is, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of sacred vse or obseruation: whence the title of <hi>Vates</hi> did descend vnto secular or prophane Poets, which retained the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and manner of speech vsed by the former.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 That such as were <hi>Vates</hi> indeed, were raught to this sublimity of speech by admiration of extraordinary euents, may be confirmed by the historicall narrations of the sacred story: wherin poeticall hymns or songs are the vsual consequents of strange or wonderful euents.

                           <p n="4">4 That the frequent vse of Poetrie among the ancient heathen, did arise from like occasions, may be gathered from <hi>Strabo:</hi> who from antiquitie,<note place="margin">Strabo. init. lib. <hi>1</hi>
                              </note> better knowne to him than vs, auoucheth it as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable, that all other set speech, whether historicall or rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, was but the progenie of Poetrie, falling in later times from its wonted state and dignitie; wheras the Ancients knew no other branch of artificial or set speech, but only Poetrie. Albeit to speake properly, it was (in respect of the efficient or impulsiue causes) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther super artificiall, than naturall or artificiall; and Rhetorick and Historie only artificiall. This opinion will not seeme strange, if we consider, that the wiser sort in those times did commend such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters only to writing, as might inflame posteritie with deuotion and loue of vertue. For Poetrie, as the same Author tels vs, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by Antiquitie, <hi>prima quaedam Philosophia,</hi> a kind of sacred morall Philosophie, appropriated, as it seemes, at the first to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or representation of supernaturall euents or diuine matters only: of which the most ancient had best experience, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to communicate them to posteritie, eleuated (as is obserued before) by the excellency of the obiect to this celestiall kind of speech, which is most apt to rauish yonger wits, as it selfe was bred of admiration. This vse of Poetrie appeares in some fragments of most ancient Poets, in their kind proportionable to the booke of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7863:60"/> Psalmes, of <hi>Iob,</hi> and the songs of <hi>Moses,</hi> the only patternes of true Poesie: whose subiects, vsually, are the wonderfull works of God manifested vnto mē. Some degenerate footsteps of these holy men the heathen, about <hi>Homers</hi> time, did obserue: vsing their Poets and Musicians for planting modestie and chastitie amongst other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in their auditors. So <hi>Agamemnon</hi> left the musicall Poet as Gardian to <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> who continued chaste and loyall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Aegistus</hi> got the Poet conueyed into an vninhabited Iland.<note n="*" place="margin">

That might perhaps be true of the Comicall Latine Poets;

                                 <l>Id sibi negoti credidit solum dari,</l>
                                 <l>Populo vt placerent quas fecisset fabulas.</l>

                           <p>Which not withstanding had neither beene the onely, nor chiefe vse; no end at al, but rather an adiunct of Poetrie amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: by the wiser and better sort of whom nothing was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, at least approued as truly delightfull, which was not also ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and of profitable vse for bettering life and manners. The law of nature being then lesse defaced: they could read it without spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, comprehend al the three elements of goodnesse, iointly vnder one entire conceit, as we do the product of diuers letters or sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in one word, without examination of their seueral value apart. But when the vnion of this trinity wherin the nature of complet &amp; perfect goodnes cōsist, was once dissolued in mens harts, &amp; delight had found a peculiar issue without mixture of honesty or vtility: the desire of becomming popular Poets, did breed the bane of true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esy, &amp; those sacred numbers, which had bin as amulets against vice,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7863:61"/> became incentiues vnto lust. Or if we would but search the natiue vse of poetrie by that end which men, not led awry by hopes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, or gaine, or other externall respects, but directed rather by the internall impulsion of this facultie and secret working of their soules, do aime at: it principally serues for venting extraordinarie affections. No man almost so dul, but will be poetically affected in the subiect of his strongest passions. As we see by experience, that where the occasiōs either of ioy for the fortunate valour, or sorrow for the mishaps of their countrimen, or alliance, are most rife, this disposition is both most pregnant and most common. And as speech or articulation of voices in generall, was giuen to man for communicating his conceits or meaning vnto others: so Poetrie, the excellēcy of speech, serues for the more liuely expressing of his choicer conceits, for beautifying his darling thoughts or fancies, which almost disdain to go abroad in other than this exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned attire, the soules wooing suits (if I may so speak) wherby she wins others to sympathize with her in abūdance of griefe, or to cōsent with her in excessiue ioy, or finally to settle their admiratiō or dislike where she doth hers. And the more strange or wonderful the matter conceiued, or to be represented, is, the more pleasant &amp; admirable will the true and natural representation of it be: and the more he that conceiues it, is rauished with delight of its beauty or goodnes; the more will he long to communicate his conceit &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it to others. Whence, such as had seen the wonders of God and had bin fed with his hidden Mannah,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.8.</note> sought by their liuely and heartie representations to inuite others, as the Psalmist doth, <hi>to tast and see the goodnesse of the Lord,</hi> as birds and beasts, when they haue found pleasant food, call (on their fashion) vnto others of the same kind, to be partakers with thē in their ioy: vntill Satan, who hunts after the life of man, as man doth after the life of birds, did inuent his counterfaite cals to allure our soules into his snare. For, when men had once taken a delight in the naturall representation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, delightfull in themselues: he stirred vp others to inuent the like, albeit there were no reall truth or stability in the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and the manner of representation vsually so light and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as could argue no credence giuen by the Authors to their owne report, but rather a desire to please such as had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer set their minds to any inquisition of solid truth, whose vnsetled
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7863:61"/> fancies cannot choose but fall in loue with as many faire pictures of others pleasant imaginations as are presented to them. For, as to view the connexion of reall causes with their effects (most of all, if both bee rare, or the concurrents of circumstances vnusuall) doth much affect the iudicious minde or vnderstanding: so the quaint or curious contriuance of imaginarie rarities, set forth in splendent artificiall colours, doth captiuate the fancies of such as are not established in the loue of truth. But (as the Orator said of such as applauded the Tragedie of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi>) how would such mens soules be rauished, could they vpon sure grounds bee perswaded, that these stories were true, albeit deuoid of artificiall colours, or poeticall contriuances, neuer vsed by sacred Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? in whose expression of wonders, the phrase is vsually most poeticall, as naturally it will alwaies, where the minde is much affected; their inuention lesse artificiall or affected, than our hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall narrations of moderne affaires; the character of their stile (as was intimated before) doth argue that they sought only to set downe the true proportion of matters seene and heard, with such resemblances as were most incident to their kinde of life. And from the efficacie of such extraordinarie effects vpon their soules, is it, that the Prophets so often expresse the same thinges in diuers wordes, as if all they could say, could not equalize the sensible experiments, which did moue their hearts and fancies (as the musitians handes or breath doth his instruments) to sound out such patheticall Ditties. Nor had their Ditties any greater disproportion with their subiect, than our Songs of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victories, haue with theirs; or other passionate Ditties, with their composers affections: albeit hee that hath experience of loue, or abundant griefe or ioy, will speake in an other dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, than ordinarily hee vseth, without any touch of affectation.</p>
                           <p n="5">5 Hence we may clearly discerne, whilest wonders decaied, and men sought as great delight in fained, as their forefathers had done in true representations: how the disproportion betwixt representations, and the reall euents, or experiments of the times, wherein the later Poets liued, became so monstrous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious. This fell out iust so, as if the armorours of this age should not obserue the stature of men now liuing, but fashion their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by old <hi>Guy</hi> of Warwicks harnes: or our painters, not looke
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7863:62"/> vpon the bodies of moderne English-men, but take their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from some ancient pictures, which had beene truly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout some thousand yeares agoe, in some other Countrie, that had yeelded men of more ample stature in that age, than this land of ours did in any. Such an error as this, which we haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Poetrie, would quickly haue beene reformed in any other facultie that had concerned mens temporall profit or commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or whereof others had been as competent iudges as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors: for so, when they had begunne to wander, or digresse a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from their right end, they should presently haue beene called to this accompt; <hi>quid adrem?</hi> your worke may be pretie, but not to our purpose. But when such admirable euents, as were well worth Poeticall expression, decreased, and worldly cares did mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, as men increased: the diuine art of Poetrie, which admits not many competent iudges in any age, was counted no better then a matter of meere delight, or recreation; and for this reason the prodigious representations of it, so monstrously disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the truth represented (because oft times more pleasant to men wearied with other studies or imploiments, than the bare narration of the truth) were neuer reformed. And so at length, that audacious licentiousnesse of fictions, for mouing delight, did in the iudgement of posteritie disparage the very patterns or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypos of poeticall representations, whereunto later Poems had beene framed. As many tall fellowes in this present age, if they should see the true image or picture of some ancient Giants, would sweare that the painter had plaied the Poet: were it not that the dead bodies or limmes of some ancient people, lately digged out of the ground, did by their vnusuall bignesse teach vs to estimate (as we say) <hi>expede Herculem,</hi> how great others might haue been, whose big limmes and bones haue not come vnto this ages sight.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 But most of these strange euents were such, as did continue no longer than while they were a doing, wherefore we must seeke out the true proportion of these heauenly bodies, by their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, represented in the later prophane Poets. The original and manner of whose digression from the patterns of the ancient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Poets, or rather from diuine truth, the patterne of ancient poetrie it selfe, was partly as you haue heard, partly as followeth.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 Gods wonderfull works haue been more plenteous in Asia,

In that time and in the ages before, or immediately succeeding it, artificiall learning was very scant; and characters, either not inuented, or their vse very rare in most places. The fresh memorie of such wonders presupposed; the liuely image either of such licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in coining fables, or confounding true histories with the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of false and vnnaturall circumstances, as these wants euery where in all time naturally breed, we may clearely behold in the moderne Turkes: who are as abundant in prodigious fables, as defectiue in good learning; and for want of printing, or neglect of writing, haue no perfect character of the worlds fashion in times past, nor any distinct order of former euents.<note place="margin">Nullam habent Turcae temporum neque atatum rationem, mire{que} historias omnes miscent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundunt: cum ijs in mentem veniet, non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebuntur affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare Regis Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomonis magistrā curiae fuisse lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, cius exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus praefectum Alexandrum Magnum, aut hijs etiam absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diora.

                           <p n="9">9 From this vicinitie of true wonders in Iurie, or thereabouts, were the Medes, Persians, and Syrians, so much adicted to fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous narrations, that their delight in such traditions did make their later writers ambitious in the skill of coining wonders; as <hi>Strabo</hi> tels vs in his 11. Booke. And Greece, as it receiued artificial learning first from Asia, so did it drinke in this humour with it. For the traditions of Gods miracles in Iurie, and the regions about it, hauing beene far spred, when Greece began first to tattle in artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall learning, the Grecians (alwaies children in true antiquitie, as the Aegyptian Priest told one of their Philosophers) were apt to counterfait the forme of ancient truths, &amp; misapply it to vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7863:63"/> matters, or foolish purposes; as children will bee doing that in homlier stuffe, which they see their elders doe in better. Finally, the same humour which yet raignes amongst men, might possesse most of the Heathen. There is no famous euent that falls out, (though it be but a notable iest) but in a short time, is ascribed to a great many more, than haue any affinitie with it. As many of <hi>Diogen▪s</hi> conceipts haue beene fathered vpon <hi>Tarleton:</hi> and what the Christians say of S. <hi>George,</hi> the Turkes ascribe to <hi>Chederley.</hi> If it be any storie concerning way-faring men; euery Hostler, Tapster, or Chamberlaine, will tell you that it fell out in their Towne, or in the Countrie thereabouts. And though you heare it in twentie seuerall places, yet shall you haue alwaies some new tricks of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition put vpon it. In like manner did the reports of sundry euents, which either fell out, only in Iurie or vpon occasion of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, flie about the world; sometime with cut and mangled, but most vsually with enlarged, artificiall wings, as if the same had been acted euery where, or the like inuented vpon euery occasion.</p>

And that sacred Poeticall spirit, which now possessed them, was as a <hi>praeludium</hi> to those hymnes and songs vttered by Christs Apostles, and his Disciples, when the spirit of God was powred vpon them, after Christs glorification. Neighbour-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, amongst whom the fame of this euent was spred, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily hence take occasion to ascribe the effect vnto the Well. And hence had Greece her <hi>Helicon,</hi> and others (by her) reputed sacred Wells, whose waters drunke did make men Poets on a sodaine; besides, that the opportunitie of such places, as <hi>Helicon</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus</hi> were, did dispose mens mindes vnto this facultie. The Daemoniacall spirits, which for this reason would frequent the same, might inspire such with poeticall furie as did obserue their

The occasion is in the same place specifyed; That <hi>Iosuah</hi> might haue a day of the Ammorites: such a day as was neuer before it, nor shal be after it. This strange miraculous euent, the heathen people of those times had noted, and deliuered it by tradition vnto their posteritie; who, after the manner of this world, sought to assigne some causes of it. The Poets in ages following, ascribe it (with some additions) vnto that vnnaturall prodigious murther, which <hi>Atreus</hi> had committed; and for ought we know, besids the reasons specified in sacred writ, God might vse this, partly as a meanes, to make Greece and other countries, that should heare of <hi>Atreus</hi> bloudie facte, stand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at such foule impietie, whereat the heauens did blush, and the sunne stood still. The times of <hi>Atreus</hi> his fact, and <hi>Iosuah</hi> his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, come neere to one point: if <hi>Statius</hi> the Poet be not farre out in his Chronologie.

Doubtlesse, vnlesse God had left this as a lasting monument to confute the incredulitie of Philosophers, by an ocular &amp; sensible demonstration, they would haue denyed the truth of this effect, as wel as they doubt of the cause, which the Scriptures assigne of it. Is the violence of that storme, which destroyed the fiue Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, strange, and aboue the force of nature? so is the qualitie of that sea, and the soile about it, contrarie to the nature of all other seas, or in-land lakes. And let the most curious Philosopher in the world giue any naturall cause of it, and the disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the cause, and the knowne effect, will be more prodigious in nature, than the cause, which <hi>Moses</hi> giues of it, is strange: some cause by their confession it must haue; and though the storme were raised by a supernaturall power, yet admitting the violence of it, to be such as the Sciptures tels vs, and the fall of so much du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matter, no cause can be conceiued, so probable in nature, as <hi>Moses</hi> giues; as out of the grounds of Philosophie, and diuerse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in nature, I could easily proue. But <hi>Strabo</hi> that great Philosopher, and no credulous antiquarie, hath cased mee of this labour. For albeit he held the Syrians for a fabulous people: yet the euident markes of Gods wrath, that had bin kindled in that place, (as concauities made by fire, distillation of pitch out of the seared rocks the noysome smell of the waters there abouts, with the reliques and ruines of auncient habitations,) made the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neighbour inhabitants seeme probable vnto him; That there had beene thirteene populous Cities in that soile, of which <hi>Sodome</hi> was the chiefe, whose circumference then remaining, was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7863:65"/> sixtie furlongs. But (as the custome is of secular Philosophers) he seekes to ascribe the cause of this desolation rather vnto Earth than Heauen, and thinkes the Lake was made by an Earthquake, which had caused the bursting out of hot waters, whose course was vpon Sulphure and Brimstone. And it is not vnlikely, that the earth did tremble, whilest the heauens did so terribly frowne, and the Almightie gaue his fearefull voice from out the clouds: and once hauing opened her mouth to swallow vp those wicked inhabitants, the exhalations of whose sinnes had bred these stormes, became afterwards a Panne or Receptacle of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, infecting all the waters which fell into it, with the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some qualities of those dregges of Gods wrath, which had first setled in it; as bad humors, when they settle in any part, plant (as it were) a new nature in the same, and turne all nutriment into their substance.</p>

The Scythians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, it was most probable, that their countrey was first inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because if fire had shut vp the wombe of their mother earth, this element did forsake theirs first, as being the coldest countrey: or if water had couered the face of nature, and made it vnapt for conception by too much moisture, this veile was first put off in Scythia, as being the highest part of the inhabited land. Vnto these reasons of the Scythians the Egyptians yeelded, as <hi>Iustin</hi> reports. Both of them erred in the manner of mans Propagation; both againe held a generall truth, in thinking mankind had some late Propagation, and that Kingdomes had not beene so frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with people in former generations, as now they were. The Scythians agreed herein with Scripture, That the higher parts of the World, which they inhabited, or parts neere vnto them, were first dried vp from the waters; for in the mountaines of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia the Arke stayed, and <hi>Noah</hi> went first on land in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The storie of whose preseruation in this Deluge, and the propagation of mankind from him, and his children, not being expressely recorded to the Scythians, they imagine that men had growne like Mushromes after raine, because they had beene so few, and now were come vnto such great multitudes.

That mankind had a new propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the time assigned by <hi>Moses</hi> of the vniuersall Floud, and that the Nations were propagated from those Regions, which <hi>Moses</hi> tels vs were allotted to the sonnes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and inhabited by his nephewes, is apparant, from the suddaine encrease of Arts and Sciences: Which were in a good measure perfect in those Countries, in times as ancient as any prophane Historie can point vnto; yet seated onely in a narrow roome, whence they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, as from a Centre, to more remote parts of the world. The ripenesse of Literature, ciuile discipline, and inuentions, amongst the Assyrians, Chaldaeans, and Egyptians, before the like did so much as bud forth in Greece, Italie, or other Countries, farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the former, doth argue, that these were the stocke, and others but slippes or branches transplanted thence. Againe, the State and Pompe of these Easterne Countries, before Greece, or Italie, or any other Westerne People, did grow into the fashion of a Kingdome or ciuile Nation, demonstrates vnto vs, That the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of those places were the heires of the world, who had the Court, Kingdome, and Metropolis amongst them, and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but as Colonies of men of meaner sort, not so neere allied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the first borne; or (as it were) of a yonger house, and farre ruder education. And it is most likely, or rather euident, that the sonnes of <hi>Iaphet</hi> did first inhabite Scythia, or the Northerne parts of Asia minor, and other parts neere adjoyning, before they came into Greece, or other Countries of Europe. And these were the sonnes of <hi>Noahs</hi> meanest posteritie, vntill the fulnesse of <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Chams</hi> iniquitie were accomplished. For as Gods promise vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> was not accomplished in his Person, but in his Posteritie, many generations after his death; so neither did his curse vpon <hi>Cham</hi> take place, till the same time. The execution of Gods curse vpon the one, was the collation of his blessing vpon the other: but the enlarging of <hi>Iaphets</hi> race came long after both. Thus the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were the first great Princes; the Assyrians, Medes, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians the next; the Grecians and Romanes after them; and in later times the race of <hi>Ismael</hi> hath beene the mightie People: for of him the Saracens lineally descend, and the Turkes, by adoption heires of the same promise.

                           <p n="6">6 The former argument drawen from the suddaine increase and propagation of men, the scarcitie of Artes, ciuil discipline and inuentions, with other experiments better knowne to them than vs, enforced certaine of the ancient Philosophers to hold a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vicissitude, some of generall, some of particular deluges, whereby the workes of antiquitie, once come to perfection, had bin, &amp; continually should be defaced; either generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, or in sundrie countries according to the extent of the inundation. This opinion might seeme more safe, because not easie to be disproued in that old world, in which the wisest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (besides the people of God) had no distinct knowledge of any thing, that had happened an hundred yeere before his owne birth; much lesse what mutations should follow after his death: but vnto vs their Prognostication is like vnto some late Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of doomes-day, confuted by a world of witnesses, euen by the continuance of euery thing after that time, which, by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, should haue imposed a fatall end to all things. We may truely vse the mockers wordes of these mockers of truth; <hi>since the olde Philosophers dyed, all things continue alike,</hi> seede-time and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest haue beene still distinct, nor hath there beene any floud to destroy either the whole earth, or any entire nation thereof. For assurance of which promise, the Almightie hath set his bow in the cloude: whose naturall causes, though the Philosophers can in some sort assigne, and shew the manner how diuersities of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arise in it; yet the ancient Poets see more, than either they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue left exprest, or later Philosophers sought to conceiue, when they faigned <hi>Iris</hi> to bee <hi>Thaumantis filia,</hi> the daughter, or (as wee of this age would say) the mother of wonderment, the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of the great God <hi>Iupiter</hi> and his Goddesse <hi>Iuno.</hi> The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of this fiction (had they bin well acquainted with them) might haue informed Philosophers, that the raine-bow had some better vse, than a bare speculation how it was made; some finall, besides the materiall and efficient cause, vnto whose search the admirable forme or composition of it did incite men naturally. And the auncient Philosophers (who were for the most part
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7863:68"/> Poets, and endued with more liuely notions of the first, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme cause of all things) did vsually assigne a finall cause, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly) supernaturall, of such effects as proceeded from efficient and materiall naturall causes.<note place="margin">Arist. <hi>2.</hi> Poster.</note> As the Pythagoraeans thought the thunder (whose matter, forme, and efficient they well knew) was made to terrifie such as were in hell; not erring in the generall, that it had some such like vse, though mistaken in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whom it was made to terrifie. Naturall Philosophie giues vs the materiall and sensible efficient causes, the Scripture one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the true and supernaturall end, which leades vs to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, inuisible, and principall efficient cause of all naturall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, euen of Nature it selfe. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowledgeth the motions or dispositions of the matter to depend vpon the end or finall cause: albeit he giues no finall cause at all of maine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, much lesse the supreme or principall finall cause of all naturall effects, but confounds the forme with the end, against his owne principles, and contrarie to the analogie betweene Nature and Art, which is the ground of all his Discourse, about the matter, forme, and efficient. For the artificiall forme is not the end of the Artists worke, but rather incites the spectator to view and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his skill, from which his gaine or fame may redound. And these (one, or both) are the principall end of all his labours: so is the glorie of the first, and supreme efficient cause, the principall and vtmost end of all the workes of Nature; and Nature it selfe (if I may so speake) the art or skill of the first and supernaturall cause. But as <hi>Aristotles</hi> Philosophie is imperfect, because it leades vs not, either vnto the first cause, or last end of all things; so is it fully sufficient to confute such Diuines, as thinke there were Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes before the Floud. Which opinion hath no pretence of Scripture to enforce it: and grounds in Nature it can haue none, vnlesse they will auouch this euident vntruth, That euerie dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Aire, or euerie Cloud, is fitly disposed to bring forth the Raine-bow. And if other naturall causes, with their motions and dispositions, depend vpon the finall; such as acknowledge the truth of Scripture haue no reason to thinke, that eyther the Clouds or Aire had that peculiar disposition which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the production of the Raine-bow, before the Floud,

Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry fragments of <hi>Orpheus, Linus, Pythagoras,</hi> yea of <hi>Euripedes,</hi> much later than the former, with many sayings of other auncient Poets and Philosophers, doe witnesse that their Authors had many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of good and euill, not much dissonant from the morall law of God, fully consonant (for their generall truth) vnto the good sentences of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends: albeit euen these were mingled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular errours of the Diuine Prouidence. Much more did the most of the heathen, since the diuision of the Iewes from other people, by their sacred Lawes, goe much euery day more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther awry from those good rules of life, which had beene natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingrafted, both in the Iewes and Gentiles hearts. These excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sayings of the auncient heathen, and their posterities credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to beleeue all reports of their Gods, demonstrate that they had obserued many wonderfull Experiments, and euident Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Diuine prouidence; and communicate the same vnto posterity, both in plaine literall morall Discourses and allegorical or mysticall fictiōs. In thus doing, perhaps not intending so much, that their successours should expect the same euents, or course of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7863:71"/> things to continue for euer: as that they should learn to reuerence these sacred powers, to glorifie them as diuine, who could alwaies alike effect what they intended, though by meanes most contrary. But vnto the heathen, destitute of Gods written word, the best obseruations of their auncestours became quickely like a Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar out of date; they could not discerne the workes of God, nor his inward secret calling, whē once the course of his proceedings, or manner of his speaking to them changed.<note place="margin">Plut. de defect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap> Oraculorum.</note> Thus <hi>Planetiades</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ascribes the defect of oracles vnto the carelesnesse or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignacie of the Gods as if, these once taken away, they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes left for procuring the welfare of mankinde. But in Iewry the true doctrine of the Diuine power, or Prouidence, was well knowne. For God by <hi>Moses</hi> had both giuen them his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Oracles as an absolute Ephemerides of all things that had bin since the first moment of Time, by whose rules they were to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all other succeeding praedictions; and also continually rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them vp Prophets, like yearely Astronomers, to continue the Ephemerides, which <hi>Moses</hi> had made for the direction of mans life, and to instruct them as it were in a monthly Kalendar of euerie particular alteration or change, vnto which that great Law-giuer in his generall praedictions could not discend. From this reason it is, that the Pen-men of the sacred story doe not alwayes relate the same, or like euents, but assigne diuers maners of his working and speaking to seuerall ages. Some afford vs liuely monuments of his power; others paterns of his wisedom; some exāples of his iustice; others, of his mercie: yet al of them continually acknowledge him to be the only author of their good, albeit the maner of procuring it be diuers, yea contrary. Thus <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and other godlie men of that time, ascribe their redemption from Babylonish cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, as immediatly to the wonderfull working of their God, as their fore-elders did their deliuerance from Aegyptian thraldom: although no such miracle of his power were seen in the later. The former deliuerāce had confirmd his omnipotent abilitie of doing what he would, the later, his infinite wisedome in doing what hee could, by what meanes he would: and it was his good pleasure to be glorified in sundry ages, by diuers manifestations of his seuerall attributes.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 But the heathen wanting his word for their direction, after
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7863:72"/> they had once begun, knew not how to make an end. If God cease to shew his miracles in any one kind, which they had heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eyther they sought to continue them by faigning the like, (more readie to play vpon former reports, than to obserue the course of Gods proceedings in their owne times:) or else from the varietie of wonderfull euents, whose cause they knew not, for they imagine a pluralitie of Gods. Others, from these mens super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and curiositie, were prone to suspect the truth of what had beene; after once such sensible euents, or experiments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to cease. This gaue the first occasion vnto Atheisme; which hath most abounded since the propagation of the Gospel, whose glorie hath quite extinguished those pettie lights, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde Heathen onely vsed for their direction, beeing most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to the flesh or sense, as the Gospel is to the Spirite. For as dimme or weake sights can make some shift with star-light or candles, that shine a farre off, but are quite put out by looking vpon the bright Sunne: So hath the brightnesse of Christs glorie reuealed, put out the eies of corrupted nature, in such as loued darkenesse more than light, and would not seeke for any remedie at his hands, which giueth sight to the blind. Yet might this their disease be sooner cured, if they would compare other Countries vanitie in faigning wonders without occasion, with this religious sobriety of the later writers of the Bible, or other godly men, who haue written of Iews affairs; not one of them since <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> time relating such wonders, as their fathers had told thē. This sobrietie in them euidently shews, that the former miracles were no fictiōs of humane fancie: otherwise the Iews, liuing betweene <hi>Ezekiahs</hi> and Christs time, would haue bin copious in their inuentions of the like, as we see by experiēce, that the learned Iews since our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiors time haue bin most ridiculously apish in coining, &amp; the illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate as grosse in beleeuing most absurd and filthy fables. That this people, during the whole time of the second temple, added no bookes to the Canon of the Bible, confirms their forefathers care, of admitting none in former times, but vpon euident &amp; sure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of their diuine authority. Again, it was most miraculous, that this people which had Prophets, and sacred Writers in euery age, before the Babylonish captiuity, should after their redemptiō thence lie so quiet, that not the most learned amōg them did euer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7863:72"/> challenge the name of Prophets; though they had men of diuine spirits, and excellent obseruation in heauenly matters, as appeares by the Author of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> the booke of Wisedome, and other books of good vse amongst all religious men, though not canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call amongst the Iews themselues. Answerable to this sobrietie of the learned was the disposition of the vnlearned among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which during the former period of time, wherin they wanted prophets, were generally most auerse from al idolatry, whereunto they were most prone, while Prophecies were most plentifull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; &amp; yet continued stil as far from Atheisme, as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. The reason of all which I haue giuen before. God had inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a general silence throughout this land, that all might hearken more attentiuely vnto the Criers voice, appointed to prepare the wayes of the Lord: after whose message once fully accomplished, as it had beene after the ringing of a market-bell, euerie Mounte-banke throughout their coasts, sets to sale the dreames and fancies of his owne braine, for diuine prophecies.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 Lastly, the Heathen in their most sacred traditions, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greatest consequence, adde circumstances according to the occurrents of their owne Times, which suite no better with the substance, or essence of their auncestors obseruations, than a Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meies slipper with a Gyants foote.

And albeit many other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and States were larger, than the Kingdome of Israel was at any time, yet no other people could be said so great a Nation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7863:83"/> as this. For others continued the same rather by identitie of soyle, or like forme of gouernment, then by any reall or materiall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or identitie of people: their increase was meerely politicall, and their greatnesse rose by way of addition or accumulation; that is, by admitting such mixture of others, that from the first erection of the Kingdome, ere it came to its full great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the number of Aliens might ouerspreade and hide the naturall inhabitants, or progenies of such as laid the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes thereof, which were seldome so continuate by direct succession, as they might be rightly distinguished from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And as <hi>Theseus</hi> his ship was accounted one and the same, because it retayned the same forme, though not so much of the same Timber, whereof it was first built, as did goe to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of halfe the keele: so the greatest States amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, retayned perhappes some few fundamentall lawes, or relikes of Ancient Families descending from their first founders, in which respect alone they might be taken for one Kingdome, but not so properly termed one People or Nation, to whom greatnesse could be truly attributed, seeing a great many of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall people were to share in this title. But these Iewes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the perpetuall vnitie, their particular, as well as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lawes, lesse varied eyther by change, addition or abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the Lawes of any other Nation) continued still one and the same people by a strict Vnion of succession, their grouth was naturall, after the manner of vitall augmentation. For albeit they admitted some mixture of strangers, they could notwithstanding alwaies distinguish the progenie of forraine stockes from their naturall branches, which they could still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue from their seuerall stemmes, and these all from one and the same roote: so that after so many changes, and alterations of their State from better to worse, and backe againe; after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glorious victories, as Scriptures mention gotten by them ouer others; and so many captiuities of their persons and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their countries, as others had wrought, they remained still one and the same people, by such a kinde of vnitie, as a great Oake is said one and the same tree, from its first spring to its last fall, whether naked and bereft of leaues by blastes of Autumne or Winters frost, or spoyled of boughes by the

For take wee this Kingdome with it defectes; what wonder can reuolutions of time affoorde like to this late mentioned? That by such an vnitie of naturall propagation from one roote, (almost perished before it sprouted,) and distinct lineall succession neuer interrupted, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> seede should continue one and the same Nation for two thousand yeares: sometimes the mightiest amongest coeuall Kingdomes, a scourge and terrour to all neighbour countries; and after many grieuous wounds and deadly, in their estimation that gaue them, receiued from others, still preserued aliue, to see the successiue rise and fall of three great and potent Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, yet able in decrepit daies, to hold play with the fourth, the mightiest that euer was on earth, euen whilest it was in it best age, full strength and perfect health, free from any intestine broyles, secure of all externall assaultes. Much better were these Iewes able to encounter the Romane Empyre, in <hi>Tacitus</hi> his life time, than it, within three hundred yeares after his death, to defend the imperiall seate against barbarous, seelie, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish nations, vnhatched when the Romane Eagle winges were spread ouer the most famous Kingdomes of the earth. Suppose the Romane Empyre had receiued,<note place="margin">The Romane Empyre had neuer the like push before it fell, as it had by the Iewes in <hi>Adrians</hi> time.</note> at the same time, but halfe so terrible a blow in Italy, as these Iewes had done in Iurie and Hierusalem vnder <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and his sonne: how easily had the commotions of their relickes, in <hi>Traeians</hi> and <hi>Adrians</hi> times, shaken the Romane yoake from off the Nations neckes? Or if the other tenne Tribes returne had beene but halfe so entire and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7863:84"/> complete, as <hi>Iudahes</hi> and <hi>Beniamins</hi> were, the Romane Eagles had neuer come to prey vpon their carkases in the territories of Iudea. But it was their strong God, which before had scattered Israel amongst the nations, and at the time appointed shut these Iewes vp in Hierusalem, as in a prison.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Againe, other Kingdomes gained little by their greatnesse, saue onely magnificent names or swelling titles. No other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple euioied so great prosperitie, so good cheape, as this sometimes did, and all times might haue done. No other had so good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance or securitie of that prosperitie or peace they enioyed, as this people had, vnlesse themselues had made a wilfull forfeiture: nor was the publike health or welfare of any other state or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome so fully communicated to euery particular and inferiour member. For vsually the titularie or abstract brightnesse of that glorie, wherewith other great states outwardly seemed most to shine, was maintained with the perpetuall harmes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall secret mischiefes of many priuate persons, as great flames are not nourished without great store of fuell: whereas the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Dauids</hi> throne, as in other points so in this, was established like the Moone: that whilest they turned vnto their God, their state was capable of greatest splendour, without consumption of their naturall partes or substance. And euen whilest other States did for their sinnes preuaile against theirs, yet such Peeres as had beene principall instruments of their woe, and tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to disgrace their Lawes or Religion, in their captiuitie and distresse, had for the most part, (as was obserued before) feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and disastrous ends: and might more iustly haue taken vp that complaint, after their spoyles of Iewrie, which <hi>Diomedes</hi> did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the destruction of Troy,

But here a Christian may as well doubt, as the Heathen wonder, Why Israel after so many transgressions, as the Author of the hundred and sixt Psalme complaines of, was not destroyed at once, as other great and mightie Nations had bin. For the more abundant fauours their fore-fathers had found, and the greater Gods blessings (layd vp for their posteritie) were, the greater was their ingratitude in rebelling, their rebellion it selfe so much more wilfully hainous; and alwaies the more wilfull or hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous any sinne is, the more grieuous, certaine, &amp; more speedie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment it deserues. How could that most just &amp; holy one, which so often protesteth he respecteth no mens persons, spare this most vngratefull, stubborne, &amp; rebellious people, longer than any other?</p>
                           <p n="4">4 The full and necessarie consequence of these collections is thus much, and no more: <hi>The finall extirpation of these Iewes had bin accomplished many generations before it came to passe, had the Lord bin only iust, or respected onely their deserts, whom he so often preserued, when iustly he might haue destroyed them.</hi> But if wee looke farther into the waies of Gods prouidence, the true end and reason of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying others, and preseruing them, wil appeare one &amp; the same. For that suddaine execution of his justice vpon others, which did so much aduance his glorie, equally practised vpon them, had as greatly impeached it amongst the nations. This cause of their long preseruation the Lord himselfe assignes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26.27. <hi>I haue said I would scatter them abroad, I would make their remembrance to cease from among men; saue that I feared the furie of the enemie, least their aduersaries should wax proud, &amp; least they should say, Our high hand, and not the Lord, hath done all this.</hi> Againe, as the Lord was most iust, so was he most kind &amp; mercifull towards all, euen towards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, in these Iewes: for by their strange deliuerance &amp; restauration
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7863:89"/> the other might haue learned, that their God was a God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, most worthie to be honored of all the world, as he himselfe addeth in the fore-cited place:<note place="margin">

                              <hi>For the Lord shall iudge his people, and repent towards his seruants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and none shut vp in Hold, nor left abroad: when men shall say, Where are their Gods, their mightie God in whom they trusted, which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and did drinke the wine of their drinke-offering? Let them rise vp and helpe you; let him be your refuge: Behold now, for I, I am he, and there is no gods with me.</hi> Thus, since these Iewes began first to be a Nation, as well the wane as the encrease of their estate; or (to vse our Apostles words) as well their <hi>diminution</hi> as <hi>abundance</hi> might haue yeelded the docile and well disposed greater riches, than the spoyles of their Cities and Countrey did the proud and mightie amongst the Gentiles. And albeit they oft times sinned more grieuously than others did, yet were there alwayes left some godly amongst this people, which in their distresse knew themselues, and could teach others the right way to repentance; of which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, one and other, were altogether ignorant. And this was an especiall cause, though subordinate to the former, of their long preseruation. For when they were not so extreame bad, as to continue in former sinnes, but vnfainedly called vpon the Lord in their distresse, he heard their prayers; and being once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to his, they found fauour at their enemies hands.

After <hi>Moses</hi> had proposed extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blessings, if they would walke in the Lawes which he had giuen them, hee threatneth them with plagues and calamities in their owne Land; as with <hi>bodily sickenesse, incursion of enemies, oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and spoyle of goods, strange ouerthrowes in battell, and feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart.</hi> And if these would not reclaime them, then hee threatneth to punish them seauen times more according to their sinnes: as with <hi>barrennesse of soyle, prodigious famine, and scarcity of fruit.</hi> And yet if they hold on stil to work stubbornly against him, he threatneth to multiply the former plagues seuen times; by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>wild beasts among them, which should spoile them &amp; destroy their cattell, and make them few in number, and your high-waies shal be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate.</hi> The like multiplying of his plagues, for the increase of their stubbornenesse, hee reiterates twice againe <hi>ver.</hi> 23. to the 27. <hi>Yet, if by those you will not be reformed &amp;c.</hi> hee increaseth all the former plagues seauen times againe, <hi>verse</hi> 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, and 36, 37, 38. The first and second degrees of the plagues threatned, were in part fulfilled in the dayes of <hi>Gedeon, Samson, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> The third likewise (by wilde beastes) wee see fulfilled in the dayes of <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of Israel, 2. <hi>Kings chap.</hi> 17. <hi>verse</hi> 25, 26. The fourth and fift likewise wee see in part fulfilled in the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Israel in Iudah, in the dayes of <hi>Manasseh, Iehoiachim,</hi> and <hi>Tzedechiah;</hi> and in the time of <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the first, vnder <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Both their owne and other Stories, giue vs full Experiments of this Prophecie. As their stubbornenesse did increase, so Gods plagues here threatned did wax more grieuous:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7863:90"/> these later calamities being, at the least, seuen times greater (both for extent and duraunce) than the former persecutions, which they suffered by the Philistims, Moabites, Aramites, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites. But the fifth and last plague, which containeth all the rest more than seuen times, was not accomplished till after our Sauiours death: after which time, all the rest (in part fulfilled before) are more than seuen times multiplied vppon them. In their former ouerthrowes or captiuities, they suffered the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of warre, and oftentimes felt the extremitie of hostile lawes: but after these storms were past, so they would submit themselues vnto their conquerors, they vsually found (as was shewed before) more than ordinary fauour at their hands. But since our Sauiors death, the memory of their former plagues hath bin but an inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the like, or worse; their continuall bad vsage prescribing the lawfulnesse of their abuse. In the 28. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary blessings, and plagues which were to ouertake this people, either in their life or death, are more exactly calculated. And albeit their blessings might haue beene more, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, than the curses that haue befallen them: yet <hi>Moses</hi> (it seemes) foreseeing, or fearing what would be, rather than hoping the best that might be, is almost foure times as long in calculating their plagues, as their blessings. So haue the miseries of these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iewes beene foure times as long, as the prosperitie of their worthy auncestours; if wee would take an exact measure of the one, from the sacred histories before the Babylonish captiuity, of the later from experience and relation of Iewish or Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And yet no plague, either knowne by experience, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Writers, but is euidently foretold by <hi>Moses.</hi> His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular praedictions shall be inserted, as the euents shall giue the occasion throughout this Discourse. To beginne with that most horrible plague, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.53. <hi>&amp;c. And thou shalt eate the fruit of thy body, euen the flesh of thy sonnes and thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee, during the siege and straitnesse, wherein thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my shall inclose thee. So that the man that is tender and exceeding dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among you, shall be grieued at his brother, and at his wife that lieth in his bosome, and at the remnant of his children, which he hath yet left. For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whome he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siege and straitnes,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7863:90"/> wherein the enemy shall besiege thee in all thy Citties. The tender and dainty woman among you, which neuer could venture to set the soale of her foote on the ground (for her softnesse and tendernesse) shall be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at her husband that lieth in her bosome, and at her sonne, and at her daughter, and at her after birth, that shall come out from betweene her feet; and at her children which she shall beare. For when all things lacke she shall eate them secretly, during the siege and straitnes, wherein thine enemy shall besiege thee in thy Cities.</hi> This prophecie we see fulfilled, to an haires breadth, in <hi>Vespasians</hi> time.</p>

Though the later (much degenerate from so worthy a Father, most dislike vnto his noble brother) was most vnworthie, and vncapable of so high a place, but onelie from his Fathers deserts, which GOD had ordayned, should be rewarded with this honour. Had either of his sonnes rendered according to the reward bestowed vppon them, more Scepters had sprung from the <hi>Flauian</hi> stocke: but as it grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, so did it quickly fade; <hi>Titus,</hi> the fairest branch to all mens seeming, beeing plucked off, to his great hearts griefe, in the Blossome, for what secret sinne, GOD knoweth best, this one was grieuous enough, to haue deserued a more grieuous death, that apprehending his Fates approach, hee durst so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently looke Heauen in the face, and expostulate his vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death as vniust, seeing hee neuer had offended the sacred Powers thereof but onelie once. The Signes of those Times were extraordinarie, could the Romanes haue rightly obserued them: but these great Conquerours were taken with their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues errour in not discerning, or mis-applying them.

For that Generation with whome our Sauiour Christ Iesus conuersed on earth, was not fully past, vntill this people beganne to swell with insolent and prowde hopes of soueraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer others, and by their vntimely prouocation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes bring suddayne destruction vppon themselues; as stowt and full bodies, by violent and vnseasonable exercises, are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest brought downe from the height of their strength, vnto the graue. The Romanes agayne, seeing these Iewes defeated, and themselues possessed of their hopes, (<hi>Vespasian</hi> beeing called to the Empire during these warres, which <hi>Titus</hi> his sonne did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously finish, to the vtter ruine of that Nation) thinke sure their Gods had beene more potent than the GOD of the Iewes, and apply the Prophecie,<note place="margin">Suetonius in Vespasiano &amp; Tacitus, hist. li. <hi>5.</hi> Vid annot. ex Tacito infra paragr: <hi>7.</hi> &amp; ex Sueton. supra <hi>4.</hi>

So doeth the God of this World still blinde the eyes of the worldly-wise with faire shewes or earthly shadowes of heauenly things, that they can not, or care not to looke into the bodie or substance of Diuine mysteries, for whose representation onely those are giuen; otherwise vncapable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cause eyther in Nature, Reason, or Policie. <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperour (indeede) was the second type or shadow of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, that great Monarch and Prince of Peace, whose endlesse Kingdome shall put downe all warres for euer. For seeing by the fall of these Iewes, as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saieth, <hi>Saluation is come vnto the Gentiles,</hi> it pleased the wisedome of our GOD, to haue their destruction solempnized with the selfe-same signes, that his birth had beene, which brought foorth life vnto the world.</p>

Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasians</hi> secret instinct in this deuotion did aime no doubt (as it was directed by all signes of the time) at the true Prince of peace, but was choaked and stifled in the issue or passage, and his intent blinded in the apprehension, by the palpable and grosse conceipts of Romish Idolatrie, wherein hee had beene nuz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; as mens in-bredde desire of true happinesse is vsually taken vp and blind-folded by such pleasant sensible obiectes, as they most accustome themselues vnto. And yet, God knowes, whether this vertuous Emperours last hopes were inwardly rooted in pride and presumption of heart; or rightly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued there, were onely brought foorth amisse. As if a man should first apprehend the state of blessednesse or regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a dreame, the representation of it would bee grosse, though the apprehension sound. Quite contrarie to his sonnes disposition, when hee himselfe apprehends death comming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, which the Physitians and Astronomers could not perswade him to beware of, hee solaced himselfe with this saying; <hi>Now shall I be a God:</hi> his inward hopes of a celestiall state after this life might (for ought that any man knowes) be true and sound, and the representation onely tainted with the Romanes grosse conceipt.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7863:94"/> Which assertion would haue ministred suspition to such as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all Stories by rules of policie, vnlesse some Romane writer had auouched it, seeing <hi>Pompey</hi> had razed the Citie-walles, and <hi>Sossius</hi> had taken it by force in <hi>Augustus</hi> time; since continuing in subiection vnto the Romanes vntill the last and fatall rebellion. But <hi>Tacitus</hi> telleth vs, that these Iewes made their benefite of <hi>Claudius</hi> his couetousnesse, and purchased licence to fortifie the Citie in time of peace against warre: during which it grew more populous than before, by the reliques of other ruinated Cities resorting vnto it. And albeit hee differ from <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the number of the besieged; yet hee acknowledgeth sixe hundred thousand of all sorts; the women as resolute as the men; armour and munition enough for as many as could; and yet more in this people that durst vse and manage them, than could bee expected in such a number. Their seditious, and factious, their stubborne and desperate mindes against God and man, and their owne soules, neglectiue of fearefull signes from Heauen, and other prodigious tokens foretelling their desolation, are pathetically described by the same writer. The preparations likewise on <hi>Titus</hi> his part wee may gather from him, to bee as great as any Romane euer vsed. His armie, at the first approach into the Citie, thought skorne to expect the helpe of famine to make the besieged yeelde; and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one or two assaults made to like purpose, enforced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, vntill all the engines of batterie, either of auncient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne inuention, were made readie. All these circumstances wee haue fully set downe in this fragment of <hi>Tacitus</hi> which is left.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 Were that register of Hierusalems tragicall funerals (to vse his words) now extant as entire, as hee intended it, what other conclusion from the former premises could wee expect, than such woe and miseries as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and others haue related to vs? <hi>Iosephus</hi> (as if <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> spirit had directed his penne) saith their miserie did farre surpasse all plagues inflicted vpon any Nation, either by God or man. The multitude of Iurie dead in the warres, was equall to the number of liuing men in Israell vnder King <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                              <pb n="140" facs="tcp:7863:95"/> when <hi>Iacobs</hi> posteritie florished most, besides fiftie thousand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captiues. The number (albeit he maketh it eleuen hundred thousand) cannot seeme strange, if wee consider the confluence of this people from all Nations almost vnder heauen vnto Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem at their Passeouer. <hi>Dion</hi> telleth vs, that besides the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inhabitans of Iewrie, strangers, not onely of Iewish proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but such as obserued their rites and customes, did flock to the Cities defence, both from those parts of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, through which they were scattered, and from the Countries beyond Euphrates not subiect to the Romanes: consonant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to <hi>Iosephus,</hi> where hee telleth vs that the greatest part of the slaine were strangers, but most of Iewish progenie. The whole Nation (to vse his words) was shut vp by fates, as in a prison, or to speake more significantly, foyled by the Romanes in the field: they were driuen into the Citie as into a slaughter house. And heere the Psalmists curse beginneth to seize vpon the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that which should haue beene for their good proues the occasion of their fall:</hi> the effect of Gods blessing vpon <hi>Abraham</hi> proues a plague to his seede: the huge number, wherewith God had mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied them, which had late made them swell with hopes of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie in the open field, brings grieuous famine suddenly vpon them once inclosed in the Citie: and famine no sooner got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walles, but lets in her fellow-messengers of Gods wrath; first breeding the pestilence by the carkases of the famished, then disposing the bodies of the liuing to receiue this and such other loathsome infectious diseases, as hunger and the huge multitude of the besieged in such a strait place would quickly breed; and yet they so desperatly set to increase these miseries, as euen in their greatest penurie to receiue fugitiues from <hi>Titus</hi> Campe. For, as <hi>Dion</hi> storieth, diuerse of his souldiers fled to the besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, being partly wearied of the difficult siege, partly animated thereto, by a rumour bruted throughout the Romane armie, that this citie could not be taken.</p>
                           <p n="7">7 Thus all occasions conspire to worke them woe whom God will plague. The generall perswasion of the East, that Iewrie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, should bring foorth the Monarch of the world, ministers matter for their false prophets to worke vpon: and from their trust in their Prophets, it was that neither the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

God (no doubt) had so disposed, that the Romaine Souldiers should dispaire of victorie, to giue countenance to these false Prophets, and make these cast-a-waies, who still delighted most in lies, more confident in the waies of death.

                              <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> might seeme fearefull, yet their interpretation was ambiguous: they might as well menace their enemies harme, as their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; howsoeuer to regard them much might argue Heathenish superstition; and in discreet auoidance of superstition, makes hypocriticall Professors of true religion preposterously stubborne in imitation of true confidence. They could pretend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets admonition: <hi>Learne not the waies of the Heathen, and be not afraide for the signes of heauen, though the Heathen be afraide of such. For the customes of the people are vaine;</hi> and hence assume his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to themselues <hi>paueant illi, ne autem paueas tu;</hi> Let the idolatrous Heathen tremble and quake, but why should Israell bee afraid at these apparitions of their God? Or if a man would haue measured all by politike obseruations, it was more likely the Romaines should haue forsaken the siege, than the besieged haue fallen into their handes. But God was against them, and they could not be for themselues. For, as <hi>Dion</hi> notes, (which I thinke <hi>Iosephus</hi> omitteth) they themselues, by making way for their more commodious defence, did (against their will) demolish the chiefe muniment of the Temple; at which breach the Romaines entred, but not without some stay, amated only with reuerence of the place. Nor did the successe answere to their resolution in the assault (albeit they were farre more in number than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants) vntill <hi>Titus</hi> commanded part of the Temple to be set on fire. But then, as the same Author witnesseth, some offered their bodies for sheaths vnto the Romaines swords; some killed their fellowes, requited instantly with like kindnesse from them againe; some lept into the fire; all accompted it their happinesse to perish with the Temple.</p>
                           <p n="8">8 The Lord had often professed his dislike vnto their solemne feasts, and his loathing of their sacrifices; both fully manifested
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7863:96"/> in this their last calamitie, such as the stench of their dead was now to their polluted senses, such had the abhomination of their sweetest incense long beene to his holinesse, now to bee purged with the Priests owne bloud, sacrificed in the flames and ruines of the Temple: the Citie, as oft before, was now taken vpon the Sabaoth day. Other particular miseries, described by <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> I leaue for this time to the Readers priuate medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: desirous only in these generalities, to iustifie theirs or other Ecclesiasticall writers reports, against all suspitions cast vpon them by Atheists or Infidels, from the testimonie of such as Infidelitie it selfe cannot suspect for partiall.

                           <p n="2">2 Many particulars, here set downe by <hi>Ieremie,</hi> are not so much as once intimated by the sacred storie, which describes the siege by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> But no calamitie either intimated by any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall relations of those times, or prefigured in <hi>Ieremies</hi> cōplaint, but in this later siege by <hi>Titus,</hi> is most exactly fulfilled: as if the Lord had but sowne the seedes of destruction and desolation by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> which now come to their ful growth &amp; ripenesse, this people must reape according to the full measure of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. They are as drie stubble, and the Romans as a consuming fire. <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Host perhaps slew some, but had no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make a generall massacre in the Temple, destitute of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants ere it was taken the King and his greatest Commanders being first fled into the wildernesse; nor was it destroied vntill the heate of warre was past, and most of the people led into captiuitie. But whilest in this later destruction by <hi>Titus,</hi> it fell by the furious heate and brunt of Warre, the number of such, as were either willing or forced to end their daies with it, was of all sorts excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great: and which was most miserable, many who had taken their farewell of life &amp; had bid death welcome, reuiued againe to renew their more than deadly sorrowes, &amp; to reiterate their bitter complaints, which this lamentable accidēt could only teach them to act aright, and vtter with such tragicall and hideous accent, as was be fitting a calamitie so strange and fearefull as neuer had been knowne before. Euen such as famine had caused to faint, hauing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7863:97"/> their vocall instruments clung together, and their eies more than halfe closed vp with death, vpon sight or noise of the Temples crackling in its last and fatall fire, rowsed vp their spirits and resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their wonted strength, to proclaime vnto all neighbour-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in shrill and lowdest out-cries; <hi>That there was neuer any sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row like vnto this sorrow wherewith the Lord had afflicted them in the day of his fierce wrath,</hi> and yet they blow the fire which it had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ventilating and inlarging the deuouring flame (whose extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the abundance of their bloud did otherwise seeme to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) by violent breathing out their last breath vnto it. The gast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confusion of this fearefull spectacle and hideous noise are so liuely expressed by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and others, that they may well serue the Christian Reader, as a mappe of hellish miserie. I only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the fullfilling of <hi>Ieremies</hi> prophecie,<note place="margin">Joseph. lib. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> De bello Iudaic.</note> in particulars related by <hi>Iosephus:</hi> as of the womans eating her child, a thing<note n="*" place="margin">So the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of his relation plainly showes</note> neuer heard of in that or any Nation before: of the Priests slaughter both in the Temple, and after the destruction of it. For <hi>Titus,</hi> otherwise inclined to mercie, seeing it consumed by fire, which he sought by all meanes to saue, commanded such of the Priests, as had escaped the flame, in a by-roome adioyning, to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, telling them, it was fit they should perish with the Temple, for whose sake, might it haue stood, hee willingly would haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their liues. Againe, the massacre of the promiscuous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of women and children, vnfit for Warre, are particularly described with all the circumstances by <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the eleuenth Chapter of his seuenth Booke:<note place="margin">

                           <p n="3">3 Thus <hi>Moses</hi> fore-showes the grieuous plagues, which hung ouer this Nations head, but then a-farre off: <hi>Ieremie</hi> after points out the very place where they shall fall; our Sauiour Christ only knew the distinct period of time,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.</note> wherein both the former prophecies should be accomplished. I will not trouble the Reader with rehearsall of particular calamities fore-told by him; their obseruation is alreadie made vnto his hand by <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and will apply themselues, being compared with <hi>Iosephus;</hi> so perhaps will not some places of Scripture following, though
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7863:97"/> as much concerning the same times. For the better vnderstanding of which we must call to mind, what was obserued before; That Hierusalem was the Lords owne seate, and the Iewes a people set a-part by him, and distinguished of purpose from others, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie his mercie and iustice in their prosperitie and distresse. Consequent hereunto his pleasure was, that in the desolation of Iurie, and destruction of the Temple, other Nations should bee put in minde of their mortalitie, and not thinke in their hearts that these were greater sinners than any other Nation; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he who plagued them was Lord of the whole earth, as well as Iewrie; that the like and more fearefull iudgements did hang ouer their heads, vnlesse they would learne by the knowne calamities of this people, to auoide them. So saith the Lord to all the earth without exception:<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Iere</hi> 25.29.</note>
                              <hi>For loe I beginne to plague the Citie where my name is called vpon, and should you goe free? yee shall not goe quit: for I will call for a sword vpon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of Hosts. Therefore prophecie thou against them all these wordes, and say vnto them; The Lord shall roare from aboue, and thrust out his voice from his holy habitation: he shall roare vpon his habitation, and crie aloude, as they that presse the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. The sound shall come to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a controuersie with the Nations, and will enter into iudgement with all flesh, and he will giue them, that are wicked, to the sword. And thus saith the Lord God of Hosts; behold a plague shall goe forth from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Nation, and a great whirle-winde shall bee raised from the coasts of the earth, and the flame of the Lord shall be at that day, from one end of the earth euen vnto the other end of the earth; they shall not be mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither gathered nor buried, but shall bee as the dung vpon the ground. Howle yee sheep-heards and crie, and wallow your selues in the ashes, yee principall of the flocke: for your daies of slaughter are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and of your dispersion, and yee shall fall like precious vessels. And the flight shall faile from the sheep-heards, and the escaping from the principall of the flocke.</hi> Thus when the Citie and Temple was first destroied by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> all the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them were enforced to taste of the same cup. Babylon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that begunne the carouse, which shee meant not to pledge; hoping to make her selfe sport to see others drunke with the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7863:98"/> bloud of their slaine, was compelled at length to drinke so deepe of the dregges, till (as my Prophet speaketh) all her strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did fall, and her Princes slept their euerlasting sleepe. This prophecie notwithstanding concernes the second destruction of Hierusalem, as literally as the former: and sundrie plagues here mentioned, for ought that can bee gathered from any Historie sacred or prophane, were not in any degree verified of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the daies of <hi>Nebuchadnezzer,</hi> or his Sonne. But scarce any Nation was free from such calamities as are here described in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> and his Successors; as shall bee declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Rome her selfe, which had reioyced at <hi>Iudas</hi> miserie, and triumphed in Israels woe, troden Hierusalem vnder her feete, and giuen her dust and ashes for a couering to her naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, was shortly after pinched at the heart with like sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes; howsoeuer her outward robes of maiestie did couer her secret wounds from their eies that liued after, or beheld her estate only a-farre off, not acquainted with her inward gripes or smothered out-cries. All is not sound within that is faire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, nor they furthest from danger who feele least paine for the present: such as since haue liued securest, neither regardfull of Hierusalems miserie, nor the calamities of other Nations that ensued them, altogether vnacquainted with any like sorrowes of their owne times, shall haue their deepest share in the horrors of that dreadfull day, whereof these were but shadowes and maps, to represent vnto vs in some proportion the inconceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affrightments that shall then appeare. But as no man knowes of that day and houre, so neither did the Prophets themselues distinctly conceiue the manner of it: they did see it only in these adumbrations, which in processe of time grew still more liuely. The second destruction of Hierusalem, and the signes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, exceeds the former in the distinct prefiguration of the later day, as much as the map of a particular Countrie taken at large, doth the representation of the same in a generall map of the whole earth of like quantitie. And as maps haue a distinct quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of their owne, easie to bee knowne by sense, but which no man measures so much for it selfe, as for to know the capacitie of the Countrie which it represents: so haue most prophecies of the

For this reason hath our Sauiour Christ pictured vs out the last day by the calamities of Hierusalem only. For, vnder correction, I should thinke, that no one part of his prophecie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. from the fifteenth to the thirtie-sixth Verse, but is litterally meant, and hath beene verified of Hierusalems fatall day, and the times ensuing. For so our Sauiour concludes; <hi>Verily I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe, till all these thinges be done. All what? All he had spoken of before. What, did the signe of the Sonne of man appeare? did he send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, to gather the Elect from the foure winds?</hi> No. Christ is not yet come: the Elect are not thus gathered. Yet vpon Hierusalems destruction they had the watch-word giuen: the Nations had then a glimpse of his last comming in glorie: then it sounded the first time vnto iudgement; and the Sunne and Moone were seene in tragicall attire, that all the whole world might take notice of such a wofull Tragedie towardes, as wee expect: wherein the whole frame of nature, euen the earth it selfe, this stage of mortalitie, shall be actors; and all mankinde were then set to learne their parts. Our Sauiours comming with <hi>power and great glorie,</hi> mentioned in the ninth Verse, must bee vnderstood in such a sense, as hee is said to haue <hi>come in his Kingdome,</hi> or <hi>with power,</hi> at his Transfiguration. And that first Verse of the ninth of <hi>Marke</hi> will best interpret the place aboue cited, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24.34. Sundrie learned Interpreters, I know, expound both places otherwise.<note n="*" place="margin">Some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret these wordes of the Gospels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, which is called the power of God: but it is vsuall in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, to attribute that vnto the Type of Pledge which is proper to the substance. And CHRITS Transfiguration was both a liuely type and pledge of his future appearance in power &amp; great glorie.</note> But, to omit the former for this present, the continuation of our Sauiours speech doth enforce

Now learne the parable of the fig-tree; when her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth forth leaues, yee know that Sommer is neare: so likewise when yee see all these thinges, know that the Kingdome of God is neare, euen at the dores. Verily I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe, till all these thinges be done.</hi> Some referre these wordes <hi>[immediatly after]</hi> to the troubles of the Church; as if their meaning were this: And immediately after God hath made an end of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Church, these signes shall follow. But who knowes when that shall be? whereas our Sauiours wordes must be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to those daies whereof he had spoken, which were comprised within determinate and set bounds, and would shortly manifest themselues; so as all men might be certaine when to expect those signes, which he promised to all the world for the confirmation of his doctrine and their faith. The full and naturall meaning of the place is, as if he had said: When you haue seene Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems fatall day, then looke for such signes in the Sun and Moone as I haue told, for the one doth prognosticate the others approch, as certainly, as the budding of the fig-tree doth Sommer. The like connexion of these fearefull signes with Hierusalems deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation we haue in S. <hi>Luke cap.</hi> 21.24. Hauing spoken before only of the tribulation of Hierusalem, hee continueth his speech: <hi>Then there shall be signes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Starres, and vpon the earth, trouble amongst the Nations with perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Sea and the Waters shall roare, and mens hearts shall faile them for feare, and for looking after those thinges which shall come on the world. For the powers of heauen shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Sonne of man come in a cloude with power and great glorie. And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7863:99"/> when these thinges beginne to come passe, then looke vp and lift vp your heads, for your redemption draweth neere. And hee spake to them a parable; Behold the figge tree and all trees, when they now shoot forth, yee seeing them, know of your owne selues that Summer is then neere: so likewise ye, when yee see these thinges come to passe, know yee that the Kingdome of God is neere. Verily I say vnto you; this generation shall not passe, till all these things be done.</hi> As wee are bound by Christian faith to beleeue that this prophecie is not yet, but shall bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplished at the last day: so in trueth I should suspect my heart of infidelitie, if I did not acknowledge it truely verified (in such a sense as I haue intimated) immediatly after the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hierusalem.

The Sea roared, and the Heauens resounded like noyse; huge and great crashings were heard as if the mountaines had fallen together: great stones leaped out of their places, as high as tops of hils; and after them issued abundance of fire and smoke, in so much that it darkned the ayre and obscured the Sun, as if it had beene eclypsed, so that night was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into day, and day into night. Many were perswaded, that the Giants had raysed some ciuill broyles amongst themselues, because they did see their shapes in the smoke, and heard a noyse of trumpets: others thought the world should be resolued into old Chaos, or consumed with fire; some ran out of their houses into the streets; others from the streets or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies into their houses; others from Sea to Land; some againe from the Land to the Sea.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7863:100"/> it ouer spread Egypt, Africke and Syria, choaking not onely men, but beastes and birds, poysoning fishes, and spoyling the grounds where it came. The inhabitants of Rome (whither this infection came a few daies after the fire kindled in Campania) thought that the frame of the world had beene out of ioynt: that the Sun did fall down to the earth, &amp; the earth ascend vp to heauen. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the ashes &amp; dust did not such present harme there,<note place="margin">Ios. l. <hi>7.</hi> de bol. Iudaico lib.

Amongst other harmes, these following were most remarkable: It consumed the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> of <hi>Isis,</hi> of <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Pantheon, the Diribito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus,</hi> vnto which the Iewes were not long before enioyned to pay that tribute, which they formerly had done to the Temple of Hierusalem. Thus though the Arke be taken, yet will it be the downfall of Dagon their chiefe God that tooke it: and though Hierusalem lay buried in her ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, for her peoples grieuous sinnes; yet shall hers, as all sacred pensions sacrilegiously employed, deuoure the seates of their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors. But what can we more say, than this noble Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher hath said of this euent: <hi>Id malum diuinum potius quam huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fuit:</hi> this was a calamitie more than humane, in which the finger of God was euidently seene. And as it was a type of the last day: so may it, and the like following, confirme the truth of Sodomes destruction. Nor did God speake onely once in this language to the Romane (to omit other wonderful works of God in these times, to be recounted in their proper place,) the like fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full earthquakes, with other prodigious concomitants, fell out in <hi>Traians</hi> time at Antiochia: but the harmes not terminate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her territories, or the Cities about her herewith destroyed. For abundance of soldiers and multitudes of other people did repaire from all quarters to the Emperour wintring there; some in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassages, some for suites, some vpon other businesses, some to see Playes and Pageants. Whence the dammage, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith, did redounde to all that were subiect to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empyre. This out of question was the Lords doing,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7863:101"/> that all the world might heare and feare his wondrous workes; and wondring enquire after the true causes and meaning of them.

That dreadfull woe directed against the women of Hierusalem, with child and giuing sucke, did take these Antiochians at the rebound. Women in such cases could not die, but a double death, and yet how many such were slaine none can tell. Of an infinite companie of all sorts, starued by their close imprisonment in houses, whose foundations were shrunke, the roofe remaining, onely one woman was found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, which had sustained herselfe and her childe by her milke; another childe found in the like concauitie aliue, sucking his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased mothers dugges. In fine (saith the Author) there was no kinde of violent disaster, which did not at this time befall men. For the earthquakes being caused by the Diuine power, mens wits were not their owne, nor knewe they what medicine to seeke for these mishappes. Such as were on the house-tops had not list to descend to fetch any thing out; such as were in the field, had no minde to returne backe to fetch their clothes; <hi>Traiane</hi> himselfe was drawne out at a window by no mortall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature (as this writer thinkes) so astonished with this disastrous sight, that for many daies after the earthquake had ceased, he durst not come in any house.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7863:102"/> people of God againe vnto Mount Sinai, <hi>vnto burning fire, to black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and darknesse, and tempest, vnto the sound of Trumpets, the voice of words, which they that once had heard, should not desire to heare any more?</hi> No: but he would haue the world vnderstand, That after the Gospell was once proclaimed throughout it, the Lord would shew himselfe as terrible a Iudge to all such as did not embrace the glad tidings thereof, as he had done before to the Israelites at the promulgation of the Law. Both that fearefull sight in Mount Sinai, and those other prodigious apparitions in Italie and Syria, were types and representations of that dreadfull day. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was seene and testified by the Israelites onely, because the Law was onely reuealed to them: the horrors of the later are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred by Heathen Writers, knowne and felt by the principall Nations of the world, and from them diffused to all others (as Earthquakes, which begin at the centre, leaue their effects vpon the whole surface of the Earth) because the Gospell was at that time communicate to all the inhabited or frequented parts of the world. Those prodigious signes then which the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, and the Heathen witnesse to haue beene so frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations, presently after Ierusalems destruction, and the extirpation of the Iewes, were added as so many seales, to assure the truth of the Prophets and Gospell; and to testifie both to Iew and Gentile, That if either the one did follow his Iewish sacrifice, or the other his wonted Iolatrie, after the truth of Gods new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with mankind was sealed and proclaimed, <hi>there remained no more sacrifice for sinnes, but a fearefull looking of iudgement and violent fire:</hi> that there was no other name vnder heauen able to saue them from such euerlasting flames, as they now had seene some flashes of, but onely the name of Iesus, whom the Iew had crucified. So the Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> concludes, <hi>Whosoeuer shall call on the Name of the Lord,</hi> that is, of Iesus (for now all Israel might know for a suretie, that God had made that Iesus whom they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, both Lord and Christ) <hi>he shall be saued.</hi> The fruits of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the name of the Lord, and that distinction betwixt the state of the elect and reprobate, intimated by the Prophet in the last verse of that Chapter, shall be most fully manifested in the day of judgement: For such as haue watched and prayed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, alwayes expecting their masters comming, shall vpon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7863:102"/> the first apprehension of his approach, lift vp their heads, as knowing that their redemption draweth neere. But for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otous or carelesse liuer, he shall not be able to stand before the sonne of man: in stead of calling vpon his name, he shall crie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hils, <hi>Couer me,</hi> and to the mountaines, <hi>Fall yee vpon me.</hi> Yet was the same distinction, betweene the reprobate and the elect, truely notified by the confident carriage of the Christians, in those fearefull times lately mentioned (which did so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the Heathen) as wee may gather from <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperours Decree, inhibiting the Christians persecution by the Commons of Asia. It seemes the other had accused the Christians as hurtfull persons, and offensiue to the Gods; vnto which the Emperour makes reply in this manner:<note place="margin">Euseb. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>

But God had taken him away, and yet these Iewes intreatie continues much worse vnder <hi>Richard</hi> the first, who neuer intended them like harme; only vpon his Coronation day, (with his raigne beginnes their woe, which ends not till their finall extirpation hence) not willing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto them for their presents, or (as some thinke) partly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid lest admitted to his presence, they might practize some sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7863:118"/> vpon his bodie, he gaue command that no Iew should come either within the Church, where he was crowned, or the Palace where hee was to dine. But they desirous to present him with some gift in hope to haue their Charters, and other Priuiledges, granted by other Kings, confirmed by him, presse in at the Palace gate amongst others, making (perhaps) more hast but worse speed, one of them receiuing a blow for his forwardnesse by one of the Kinges seruants, who might well iustifie the fact by the Kinges command to keepe them out. The people about the gate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the matter so, as if this Iew had beene beat by the Kings commandement, and so they thought might all the rest of that crew: and hence fall vpon them with such weapons as they could finde, as it was easie to finde bats to beate these doggish Iewes, come to their kennells; where they found but silly shelter: For albeit their houses were strong, yet the rage of the people was too great against them. With the multitude the former rumour was enlarged, that it was the Kings pleasure to haue all the Iewes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: <hi>And,</hi> as the axiome is, <hi>mens owne desires are quickly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</hi> So farre more apt they were to apprehend this rumour as true, than to examine whether it were true or no, that the Lord chiefe Iustice and other Officers, sent from the King to appease the tumult, were more likely to catch harme themselues, than to free these Iewes from present danger: some of whose houses now flaming gaue the people light to spoile &amp; rifle others in the darke. For so violently were they set to wrong them, and eate their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that they could not bee satisfied from dinner time on the one day, to two a clock on the other: many of these Iewes in the meane time being rosted, or smouldred with their goods; others leaping out of the fire fell vpon their enemies weapons. Although the outrage was such, as in a peaceable state might seeme intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; yet was the hainousnesse of the offence quite swallowed vp by the multitude of the offenders. But as the English escapt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished: so the Iewes were not amended, by their correction. Their stubbornnesse, as the Scripture tells mee, did first procure their blindnesse, and their blindnesse becomming hereditarie hath confirmed their stubbornnesse to posteritie.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 The former violence which they suffered,<note place="margin">The bruitish stupiditie of the Iewes.</note> would haue beene a sufficient caueat to any people in the world besides, to

Their perfidiousnesse and daily sucking of Christians bloud, had made them most odious in this, as in other Landes; and though a number of them be massacred to day for like attempts; yet the rest are as ready againe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to seaze vpon euery sore, either to exhaust the reliques of life from such as are shrunke in their estate, by cruell exactions, and damned vsurie; or else to intrude themselues, as wedges or instruments of diuisions, into euery breach that shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare amongst Christians, or betweene them and others. In which practize they haue beene continually crusht. Finally, their generall carriage is so odious and preposterous, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the CHRISTIAN Magistrates conspire together for their good, they themselues will certainly prouoke their owne miserie.</p>

Vnlesse they had thus riotously violated the Kings peace, the Christians had not assembled together, and the Inhabitants were afraide at all to meddle with them. But so God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that a great companie of forraigne Marriners should repaire vnto this mutinie; who, moued with indignitie of the attempt, could not content themselues with the rescue of the Conuert (at the first perhaps onely intended) but assault these mutinous Iewes, through feare repairing to their houses; which the other first rifle, then burne together with their owners, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnpunished with spoile.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7863:119"/> violence by the Kings absence, and the present mustering of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for the holy Land; vpon whom, transported hence, their partners, in euill here at home remaining, might post ouer the whole blame of the fact, of part whereof no doubt his Souldiers had beene guiltie. The like massacres of these Iewes ensued at Stamford, at Lincolne, and S. <hi>Edmundsburie</hi> shortly after; but of all others, most memorable and lamentable was that, which in the same Lent befell them at Yorke.</p>
                           <p n="6">6 The Iewes there dwelling had heard by this time, what had beene done vnto their bretheren in London, and Linne; and see now the like or greater violence intended against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: so that as <hi>Moses</hi> in the fore-cited place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>vers.</hi> 33. addeth; <hi>They became madde for the sight of their wrongs and violence,</hi>

The residue of the foure hundred, which hee had perswaded vnto this vnnaturall and Iewish act, not only willing to imitate him herein, would before their death haue enforced many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that would not yeeld vnto this Rabbines aduice, to a more violent death, had they not conueied themselues into a strong Turret, within the manie Tower, which defended them from the flames that consumed their goods. And yet these poore soules, that had scaped their fellowes violence, were borne to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the like of their Christian enemies; to their shame, who had promised them life, vpon condition they would yeeld themselues, and become Christians; which whether they meant in heart or no, as they promised, hee that trieth the secrets of all hearts doth know.

This King, albeit their wealth vnder him was much diminished, had this aduantage of his praedecessours; The English, desirous to haue them banished, and they, as willing to spite the English by their staying here, were both forward to purchase their contrarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires by large offers to the King, vntill the English at last did out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie them, by a fifteenth, which the Parliament granted for their vtter auoidance of this land; so much welcommer was their roome than companie.</p>

The sea which gaue their forefathers passage from Aegypt, did swallow vp a great number of those wealthiest Iewes at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this Land.

Now briefly to acquaint the Reader with so much of their affaires in Spaine, as may testifie some other parts of <hi>Moses</hi> his prophecie in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place. In the yeare one thousand foure hundred eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie two, the measure of their iniquitie was growne so full, that this land could not beare it: and they themselues become so abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Isabel</hi> his Queene, that none of this seede must stay within their dominions, vnlesse they will become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as sundrie of larger possessions amongst them in outward profession did, the rest were scattered thence into other countries
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7863:123"/> most into Portugall, welcome for their monie to soiourne there a certaine time: after which as many as were found in Portugall, were there to remaine as slaues vnto the King, such as would were to be transported at his costes and charges. The King himselfe (vnlesse <hi>Orosius</hi> be partiall for him) was carefull to performe his promise, to secure them of peace during their abode, and of safe passage at the time appointed. But the Marriners hauing once gotten them aboard, did make their ships as so many prisons, or houses of torture, to wrest their wealth out of their hands, length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time by circular and vnnecessarie turnings, backe and forth, vntill the Iewes had quite spent all their prouision, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enforced to buy their foode, and other necessaries of the Marriners, at what rate they pleased. And, not content with spoyle of their goods, they abuse the bodies of their wiues and daughters to their lust, not pleasant enough, vnlesse sauced with other contumelies, and indignities practized vpon their Fathers, and husbands. Finally by these marriners, too much thinking that their passengers were Iewes, and might be vsed accordingly, they forget that they themselues were Christians, and staine that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred profession with all manner base villanie and impieties. Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through this delay in shipping ouer the first companie, partly, through the abuses done vnto them, so shamefull, that the fame thereof was brought vnto their fellowes eares by the wind, which serued the Marriners backe to Portugall: the later sort remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in expectation of safe passage, eyther could not, or would not be transported at the day appointed, and so by their staying become captiues to <hi>Iohn</hi> then King of Portugall. But <hi>Emanuel</hi> his successour, not long after sets them free, vsing all other faire meanes to bring them vnto Christ, vntill <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabel</hi> his confederates, solicite these ill-thriuing plants eiection out of Portugall,<note place="margin">The Iewes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected out of Portugall and their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vsage vnder <hi>Emanuel Ʋide Osorium. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de gestis</hi> Emanuelis.</note> as vnfit to settle in any Christian soyle.

So that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must auoide his dominions by a certaine day, or else remaine there eyther free-men in Christ, or slaues and Captiues vnto him: as many of them did against their willes, not able to prouide themselues of shipping, hauing but one port at last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7863:123"/> them for their passage: whereas at the first promulgation of the Kings edict against them, they had choyce of three. The greatnesse of their number, best appearing by their confluence about the day appointed for their passage, moued the good King with compassion, to see so many thousand soules should despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately runne the waies of death; and seeing no hope of diseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the old and withered stockes, fit fewell for euerlasting flames, he was the more desirous to recouer some of their young and tender graftes, by watering them with the water of grace: and for this purpose giues strict commaundement, that all their children vnder foureteene yeares of age should bee taken from their Iewish parentes, and trayned vp in the Schoole of Christ. This sodaine and vnexpected diuorce, though inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in compassion of the children, brought greater miserie on the Parents, than if their owne flesh had beene torne from their bones. There a man (so his heart would haue serued him) might haue seene silly infants haled from their mothers breasts, more willing to embrace death, than part with them; And yet for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (least their hands by holding fast, might proue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens rackes) suffering them to bee drawne out of their tender embracements, with farre more griefe and sorrow of heart, than they had beene brought out of the wombe; Fathers enclasping their sonnes and daughters, willing to die in their armes, had these beat off, (as hoopes from vessels which they enuiron) from their childrens bodies, and eyther broken or benummed with blowes. A voyce was heard through Portugall, surpassing that in Ramah, nothing but mourning, and weeping, and lamentation, many a <hi>Leah</hi> blearing her eyes with weeping for her children, and would not be comforted; Men and women filling the heauens with more hideous outcries than the Egyptians did at their forefathers departure out of Egypt: when the first borne of euery family, throughout the land, was slaine at midnight. But these were bereft at once of all their louing children, in the open Sunne. Many of them, not able eyther to rescue or dispatch their owne bowels, become madde with the sight that their eyes had seene, and killed themselues: Others, hauing better opportunitie, account it a part of their happinesse, to be able to preuent
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7863:124"/> their childrens washing in the sacred font, by drowning them in draw-welles and ditches. In both these calamities, at the two fore-mentioned transportations, we may see those Prophecies of <hi>Moses</hi> exactly fulfilled, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>vers.</hi> 30. <hi>Thou shalt betroth a wife, and an other man shall lie with her.</hi> And again, <hi>vers.</hi> 32. <hi>Thy sons and thy daughters shall be giuen vnto an other people, and thine eyes shall faile at the sight euery day, and there shall be no power in thy hand.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Moores, professing Mahometisme, were transported from Portugall the same time, but had no such violence offered them: what was the reason? God would haue a manifest distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this and other people. The barbarous Moores had some power in their hands, and the Portugals abstaine from like vsage of them: least the report comming to the African Mahumetans eares, might haue moued them to auenge their wrongs vpon poore Christians, liuing amongst them. But these Iewes no where had any Nation, none to auenge their grieuous wrong, which the Lord God of their forefathers had ordained they should suffer, at all times, in all places wheresoeuer they haue come, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redresse.</p>

One part of which, by the Prophets owne exposition, is to be vnderstood of such as were ledde cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> signified by the good figges: the other of <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> with the residue of Hierusalem, and them that dwelt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7863:130"/> in the Land of Aegypt, represented by the badde figges. My Prophet indeede applies it only vnto them of his owne time; of whom I confesse it was litterally meant: but not only of them; but more principally, more fully and directly, of the Iewes, about, or since our Sauiours time, and his Apostles, or their followers. The parable, with the consequence thereof, is true of both; in as much as both are particulars, contained vnder that generall diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which<note n="*" place="margin">Vide supra cap. <hi>5.</hi> paraph. <hi>6.</hi>

                              <hi>Moses</hi> had made of Blessings and Cursings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall this people in diuers measures, according to their constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in good, or stubbornnesse in euill. Vnto this generall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Prophets doe still frame their prophecies, as corollaries or appendices; and so must they be applied by vs, not only to the present times wherein they wrote, but to the times of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in which both <hi>Moses</hi> his generall, and the Prophets particular prophecies were more fully accomplished, than in any age before. That which <hi>Ieremie</hi> in the third Verse of that same Chapter said of the figges, was true of this people in all ages: <hi>The good amongst them were very good, the naughtie alwaies very naughtie:</hi> but the difference greater betwixt the better sort of the ancient, and the worse of later, than betwixt the best and worst of such as liued in the middle age; greatest of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the good and badde, in our Sauiours time, or immediately after. These wordes againe of the Prophet, <hi>verse</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. are altogether as litterally, more peculiarly meant of Christs Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Disciples, than of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and the rest which returned from the captiuitie of Babylon: <hi>For I will set mine eies vpon them for good, and I will bring them againe to this Land, and I will build them, and I will plant them, and not roote them out, and I will giue them a heart to know mee, that I am the Lord, and they shall bee my people: And I will bee their God; for they shall returne vnto mee with their whole heart.</hi> So is that curse, Verse 9.10. more fully verified of the Iewes, about, or after our Sauiour Christs time, than of <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices: <hi>I will euen giue them for a terrible plague to all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Earth, and for a reproch, and for a prouerbe, for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke, and for a curse in all places, where I shall cast them. And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till

And it is to bee obserued, that he saith not, <hi>Let them know in Iacob, that God ruleth vnto the ends of the world.</hi> For we the adopted sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though liuing in these extreame parts of the world, which he neuer knew, are the true <hi>Iacob;</hi> and the naturall sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, though liuing in the Promised Land, haue no inheritance in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> all are Iewes.

And yet, as the same obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Sunnes motion from contrary tropicks to the Line, serueth our English in Summer, and the Nauigators of opposite Climes in Winter: So is the same light of Gods countenance, which shone vpon the Iews, before, turned to the Gentiles, after the fulnes of time. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the Promise of Canaan often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vnto him; but neyther hee, nor his posteritie possessed

Againe, as the Canaanites were not vtterly destroyed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Israelites were commaunded so to doe: but some relickes were reserued in the promised Land to a good purpose, by the wisedome of God: so neyther were these Iewes vtterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but a remnant was scattered abroad amongst the Gentiles, that they might know Gods mercie towards them by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vppon the other: and though Christian Princes haue oft receiued them, vpon as vniust respects, as the Israelites did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Canaanites to dwell amongst them, yet God hath still rectified their errour, and turned their euill imaginations to the great good of his chosen. Gods fauours towards them of olde, and vs of late, might bee thus paralelled in many points: and, as <hi>Moses</hi> made nothing about the Arke,<note place="margin">Exod 25 40.

The conuersion of these Iewes wee may probably expect, as the chiefe signe of later times; onely this last part of <hi>Moses</hi> prophecie, <hi>Leuiticus chapter</hi> 26. <hi>verse</hi> 44. hath not beene as yet fulfilled, but must bee in due time, for so he saith, <hi>Yet notwithstanding this</hi> (euen all the plagues and curses which hee had threatned, and wee haue seene fulfilled in these Iewes) <hi>when they shall be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neyther will I abhorre them, to destroy them vtterly, and to breake my couenant with them:</hi> For I am the Lord their GOD: <hi>But I will remember for them,</hi> the couenant of old when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, <hi>that I might be their God: I am the Lord.</hi> And the continuation of their former plagues seemeth much interrupted, the plagues themselues much mitigated, in this last Age (since the Gospel hath beene againe reuealed) as if their miserie were almost expired, and the day of their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drawing nigh. Yet would I request such as with me holde their generall conuersion, before the end of all things, as a truth probably grounded on GODS word; not to put that euill day farre from them, as if it could not take them vnawares, vntill GODS promise to this people bee accomplished.

But these obseruations can not bee made so euident to ordinary Readers, before the doctrine of Gods prouidence be vnfolded. Wherefore I must referre them partly to that place, partly to others of my Labours, which haue been most plentifull in this Argument. Onely that mutation in our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the seruitude of the Romish church, may not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">A paralell of the Israelites deliuerance from Egyptian and ours from Babylonish thraldome.</note> For, if we compare it with the Israelites departure out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: the maner of Gods prouidence exemplified at large by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in the former, is as a perfect rule to discerne the same power in the later; and the fresh experiment of the later confirmes vnto our consciences the truth of the Historie concerning the former. God from the spoyles of the Egyptians furnished the Israelites with all things necessary for their iourney; the same God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued the study of tongues, and reuealed the Arte of Printing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little before our fore-fathers departed out of Babylon, that they should not come away empty, but well furnished to wage warre with their enemies, whom they had robbed of their chiefe iewels, leauing small store of polite literature, or skill in Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; though they haue increased their faculties that way since. If wee diligently view the disposition of Gods prouidence before those times, we can not but acknowledge, that it was the same power that first caused light to shine out of darkenes, which then renewed the face of the earth againe, and brought the light of ingenious and sacred literature, foorth of the chaos of barbaritie, obscuritie, and fruitlesse curiositie, wherein it had beene long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed. It is (me thinks) a pleasant contemplation to obserue how the Worthies of the age praecedent did bestirre themselues in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and dressing armour, not vsed for many hundred yeares before, no man knowing for what purpose, vntil the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of heauen and earth giues out his commission to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did that noble, religious, and learned King <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> or <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius de Medicis,</hi> with such like, thinke of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Caluin, Bucer, Melancthon,</hi> or other champions departure from the Romish Church, when they gaue such countenance to polite learning and learned men, from whom these had their skill: yea these men themselues, and their fellowes did little thinke of such proiects, as God by them after effected, when they first beganne to vse those weapons, by which they finally foiled their mightie aduersaries. Againe, wee haue as it were, a fresh print of Gods dealing with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his like proceedings against the Pope. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> being deliuered ouer to the stubbornenesse of his owne heart, had it so hardened at last, that hee desperately looseth both life and kingdome, whilest hee wrangles with the Israelites for their cattell. The Popes heart likewise was so farre hardened for his former pride, and so strangely besotted with the sweetnesse of his owne Cup, that he cannot forgoe the very dregges, but will haue all swallowed downe, euen Indulgences themselues; that so the Lords name might be glorified in his shameful ouerthrow. Vnlesse it had bin for such a notorious and palpable blindnesse of heart, in retayning that more than heathenish and idolatrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination; the iust causes of <hi>Luthers</hi> reuolt had not bin so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to the world, nor others departure from the Romish church so generall.

For after he was cleansed (from his leprosie,) <hi>hee turned againe to the man of God, hee and all his companie, and came and stood before him, and said; Behold, now I know there is no God in all the world, but in Israel:</hi> And againe, <hi>thy seruant will henceforth offer neither burnt sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor offering, vnto any other God, saue vnto the Lord.</hi> This was as much, as if hee had said: <hi>Behold now, for the Lord is hee,</hi>

                           <p n="3">3 If the cure of leprosie, contrarie to humane expectation, could so distinctly write this diuine Oracle in an vncircumcised Aramites heart, without any patterne or written copie, whence to take it out: how much more may the Lord expect, that the like experiments in our selues should imprint his Oracles alreadie written, by <hi>Moses</hi> and other his seruants of old, in our hearts and consciences, that haue these patternes of <hi>Naaman</hi> and others registred to our handes, admonishing vs to bee obseruant in this kinde? But alas, wee are all by nature sicke of a more dangerous leprosie, than <hi>Naaman</hi> knew: and yet the most of vs farre sicker of <hi>Naamans</hi> pride, than of his leprosie. If Gods Ministers shall admonish the curious Artists, or Athenian wits of our times, as <hi>Elishah</hi> his Prophet did <hi>Naaman:</hi> they reply with <hi>Naaman</hi> in their hearts: <hi>Wee looked they should haue called vpon the name of the Lord, their God, and made vs new men in an instant: and now they bidde vs wash our selues againe and againe in the water of life, and be cleane.</hi> Are not the ancient Fountaines of Greece (that nurse of Arts, and Mother of eloquence) and the pleasant Riuers of Italie (the Schoole of delicate moderne witts) better than all the waters of Israel?

How much rather then, when he saith vnto vs, <hi>Wash your selues often in the holy fountaine, the Well of life, and yee shall bee cleane,</hi> euen from those sores, which otherwise will torment both body and soule eternally? Yea, but many reade the Scriptures againe and againe, and daily heare the word Preached publikely, and yet proue no purer in life and action than their Neighbours. The reason is, because they heare or reade them negligently; not comparing their rules with experiments daily incident to their course of life: their preparation and resolution are not proportionable to the waight and consequence of this sacred businesse; their industrie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie in obseruing and practizing the prescripts commended to their Meditations by their Pastors, doe in no wise so farre exceede their care and diligence in worldly matters, as the dignitie of these heauenly mysteries surpasseth the pleasures or commodities of this brittle earthly life: and not thus prepared to heare, or reade the Scriptures, to heare is to contemne, to reade is to prophane them: euen the often repetition of the wordes of life, without due reuerence and attention, breedes an insensibilitie or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in mens soules. Yet should not such mens want of sense breede infidelitie in others: rather this experience of so much hearing, and little doing Gods will, may confirme the truth of his word, concerning such Teachers and Hearers.

For it is not the custome of our Times to marke so much the ordering or disposition, as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or present operation of such Agents. If any thing fall out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, wee bid a plague vpon ill fortune, or curse mischance: if ought aright, wee applaud our owne or others wits that haue beene employed in the businesse, or perhaps thanke God for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion sake, that we had good lucke.

Hence doe not I maruell (though many doe) if such men in our times as reape the fruits of the fields which God hath blest, in greatest abundance, make no conscience of returning the tenth part to him that gaue the whole; when as not one of a thousand, eyther in heart or deede, or out of any distinct or cleare apprehension of his power or efficacie, or true resolution of all effects into the first fountaine whence they flow, doth attribute so much as the tenth, nay as the hundreth part to Gods doing in any euent, wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie of man or operation of second causes are apparant. We speake like Christians of matters past, recorded in Scripture; but in our discourses of moderne affaires, our Paganismes and more than Heathenish Solaecismes bewray the infidelitie of our thoughts and resolutions. And albeit wee all disclaime <hi>Manes</hi> heresie, that held one Creator of the matter, and another of more pure and better substances; yet are we infected, for the most part, with a spice of his madnesse, in making materiall Agents the authors of some effects; and the diuine power, of others.

Vntill the Article of the diuine Prouidence, and that other of the Godhead be vnfolded, these generall directions for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments in this kinde must suffice.

Would men apply their mindes vnto this studie, experience would teach them (what from enumeration of particulars may be prooued by discourse) That there is no estate on earth, nor businesse in Christendome this day on foot, but haue a ruled case in Scripture for their is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue and successe.

Finally, would men learne to be true patients, that is, would they take vp Christs yoake, and become humble and meeke, and obserue but for a while such a gentle and moderate diet, as from our Sauiours practise and doctrine might be prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by their spirituall Physitions vpon better notice of their seuerall dispositions, they would in short time, out of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward experience of that vncouth rest and ease, which by thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their soules should finde, beleeue with their hearts, and with their mouthes confesse, that these were rules of life, which could not possibly haue come from any other, but from that Diuine <hi>Aesculapius</hi> himselfe, the onely Sonne, yea the wisedome of the onely wise, inuisible, and immortall God. The more vnlikely the meanes of recouering spirituall health may seeme to naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, before men trie them, the more forcible would their good successe and issue be, for establishing true and liuely faith.

Many of them discouer themselues to be apocryphall: and albeit some of them can very hardly, or not at all, be discerned for such by their stile, character, or dissonancie to Canonicall Scriptures; yet, that none of them indeede are, or can be admitted for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, without manifest tempting of God, is euident from what hath beene obserued before, concerning Gods vnspeakeable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence in making the blinded and perfidious Iewes, his sonnes, and our bitterest enemies, such trusty feoffees for making ouer the assurances of life vnto vs. For, seeing by them he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs, onely so many Bookes of the Olde Testament, as our Church acknowledgeth: this is an infallible Argument, that his will was, wee should admit no more; Had any more beene written, before the reedifying of the Temple by <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> no doubt the Iewes would haue admitted them into their canon.

Which doubt is now diminished by their continuance in the sacred Canon so long time, without manifest documents of GODS prouidence in preseruing them, whose pleasure (it may seeme) was to haue these Bookes, of whom the Ancients most doubted, fenced &amp; guarded on the one side, by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and other canonicall Scriptures (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called in question by any, but absurd and foolish heretiques, whose humorous opinions herein died with themselues;) and on the other, by the booke of the <hi>Apocalypse:</hi> of whose authoritie though many of the Ancient for the time being, doubted; yet He that was before all times did fore-see, that it should in latter times manifest it selfe to be his worke, by euents answerable to the prophecies contained in it.

S. <hi>Iohns</hi> adiuration in the conclusion of that booke hath not only terrified all for adding vnto, or diminishing it selfe: but hath beene as it were a Seale vnto the rest of this sacred volume of the new Testament, as <hi>Malachies</hi> prophecie was to the olde; the whole canon it selfe, consisting both of the old &amp; new, continues still as the Arke of God, and all other counterfeits as <hi>Dagon.</hi>

For by the breath of the Lord shal she be destroied; her doom is already read by S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> and the Lord of late hath intangled her in her owne snare, whilest she was drawing it to catch others. Her childrens brags of their mothers infallibilitie, wherewith they hale most seely soules to them, were too far spread before the Trent councel, too cōmodious to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in on a sodaine. Had they then begun to deny the authority of this book (thogh thē pronoūcing their mothers wo more openly than any prophecies of olde had done the ensuing desolations of the Iewes) euery child could haue caught hold on this string, that this Church (as they suppose) alwayes the same, neuer obnoxious to any errour, had in former time acknowledged it for authentike &amp; diuine: albeit (no question,) but many of them since haue wish'd

Which indeede is the briefest answere that can be giuen: but such as would require a long Apologie for its truth, or at least a large explication in what sense it were true, if any man durst be so bold as to reply vpon it.<note n="*" place="margin">How our firme assent to some principal matters reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, tieth our faith vnto their whole Canon.</note> Consequently, to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer principles, we may answere, that our full and vndoubted as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto some principall parts, doth binde vs vnto the whole frame of Scriptures. But you will say, wee beleeue such speciall parts, from vndoubted experience of their truth in our hearts, and without these our beleefe of them could not bee so stedfast: how then shall we stedfastly beleeue those parts, of whose diuine truth we haue no such experiments; for of euery sentence in Scripture, we suppose few or none can haue any? yet euen vnto those parts whereof we haue no experiments in particular, we doe adhere by our former faith, because our soules and consciences are as it were
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7863:141"/> tied and fastned vnto other parts wherewith they are conioyned, as the pinning and nailing of two plaine bodies in some few parts, doth make them stick close together in all, so as the one can not be pulled from the other in any part, whilest their fastning holds. It will bee replied, that this similitude would hold together, if one part of Canonicall Scripture were so firmly or naturally vnited to another, as the diuers portions of one and the same continuate or solid body are: but seeing it is euident that so they are not, who can warrant the contrarie, but that a sentence or period, perhaps a whole page, might haue beene foisted into the Canon by some Scribe or other? Here we must retire vnto our first hold or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of faith. For if we stedfastly beleeue from experiments or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, that some principall parts of Scripture haue come from God, and that the same are sure pledges for mans good, the only meanes of his saluation: this doctrine or experience of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence once fully established, will establish our faith and assent vnto other parts of his word, whereof (should we take them alone) we could haue no such experiments. For he that knoweth God, or his prouidence a-right; knowes this withall, that hee will not suffer vs to be tempted aboue our strength. And once hauing had experience of his mercies past, we can not, without iniurie to his diuine Maiestie, but in confidence of it, beleeue and hope, that his all-seeing wisdome &amp; almightie power will still (maugre the spite of Death, Hell, and Sathan, and their Agents) preserue his sacred word sincere without admixture of any prophane, false, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions that might ouerthrow, or peruert our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Hereto we may referre all former documents of his care and prouidence in preseruing the Canon of our faith from the tyrannie of such, as sought vtterly to deface it; and the treacherie of others, who sought to corrupt it. And it ought to be no little motiue vnto vs, thus to thinke: when we see <hi>Austine, Gregorie,</hi> and other of the ancient writers, either maimed, or mangled, or purged of their best bloud, where they make against the Romish Church; or else her vntruths fathered vpon them, by her shamelesse sonnes, in places where they are silent for her: &amp; yet this sacred volume vntouched and vncorrupt, by any violence offered to it by that Church; only it hath lost it naturall beautie and complexion, by long durance in that homely and vulgar prison, wherunto they haue confined it.</p>

                              <pb n="234" facs="tcp:7863:142"/>2 But as from these and like documents of Gods care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence in preseruing it, and of his loue and fauour towards vs, we conceiue faith and sure hope, that he will not suffer vs to bee tempted with doubts of this nature, aboue our strength: so must we be as farre from tempting him, by these or like vnnecessarie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable curious demands. How should we know this or that clause or sentence (if we should find them alone) <hi>to be Gods word?</hi> Why might not an Heretike of malice haue forged, or a Scribe through negligence altered them? It should suffice that they haue beene commended to vs not alone, but accompanied with such O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as we haue already entertained for diuine. And if any doubt shall happen to arise, we must relie vpon that Oracle, of whose truth euery true Christian hath, and all that would be such, may haue sure triall. <hi>Deus cum tentatione simul vires dabit:</hi> God with the temptation will giue issue; yea ioyfull issue to such temptations as he suffers to be suggested by others, not vnto such as we thrust our selues into by our needlesse curiositie. When we are called vnto the search of truth by Sathan or his instruments obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, the Lord will giue vs better reasons for our owne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers satisfactions, than yet we know of, or should be able to find: but by the conduct of his vntempted prouidence.</p>

The greater the reward proposed to the faithfull pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, or the punishmēt threatned to the neglect of these diuine Oracles: the greater is the madnesse of many men in our time, who in contēplatiue studies whose principall end is delight, can vndergo long toyle, and great paines, neuer attaining to exact knowledge, but by beleeuing their instructors and taking many theoremes and conclusions vpon trust, before they can make infallible triall of their truth: and yet in matters of their saluation, which cannot be exactly knowne, but onely beleeued in this life, and whose beliefe must be got by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7863:142"/> practise, not by discourse, demand euidence of truth, and infallible demonstration, before they will vouchsafe to beleeue or aduenture their paines on their practise, and finally, so demeane themselues in speech and resolution, as if God Almightie should thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe highly graced, and our Sauiour, his sonne, much beholden to them, that they would deigne to be his schollers, sooner than <hi>Mahomets,</hi> or <hi>Machiauels.</hi> But we that are his messengers must not debase his word, nor disparage our calling by wooing them vpon such termes, or professing to shew thē the truth before they be willing to learne it: One first principle whereof is this, That such as will seeke, may finde starting holes enough to runne out of Christs fold, and escape his mercies profered in his Church. And as many reasons are daily brought, sufficient to perswade a right disposed vnderstanding of the truth of Scriptures: so no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be found of force enough to conuince a froward will, or perswade peruerse affection. These are they which make a many altogether vncapable of any moral, most of all of any diuine truth, and must be laid aside at the first entrance into the schole of Christ, and continually kept vnder by the rod of his iudgements and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of that dreadfull day. Vnto such as account these conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents lesse dreadfull or their dread lesse probable, than that they should (for a time at least) lay aside all peruersitie of will, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of contradiction, to make sure triall of those diuine Oracles for their good; we can apply no other medicine, but that of Saint <hi>Iohn: He that is filthie, let him be filthie still.</hi>

What then? must they infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, and vnder paine of damnation, beleeue that you do not erre in your translations of them? or must they stedfastly beleeue, that you interprete their decrees aright? Nay euen those decrees, which you hold infallible, condemne all priuate interpretation of them: and your greatest Clearks daily dissent about the meaning of the Trent-Councell in sundrie points.

For, if they should be thus infallibly

Otherwise, your infallibilitie in not erring, were greater than your Popes or Churches: for they both may erre vnlesse they speake <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> Now, whether the Pope speak this or that <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> or whether he speake or write at all or no, is not known to any of the cōmon people in these Northern countries, but onely by your report: which if it be not infallible, and as free from errour as the Pope himselfe, the people must still stagger in faith. Nor doe I see any possible remedie: vnlesse euery man should take a pilgrimage to Rome, or vnlesse you would bring the Pope throughout these countries, as men vse monsters or strange sightes. Yet, how should they be certaine that this is the Pope, rather than some counterfeit? or how should they know Rome, but by others? Or can you hope to salue this inconuenience by an implicite or hypotheticall faith? as, that it were enough for the lay people to beleeue absolutely and stedfastly, that the Pope, or Church cannot erre: but to beleeue your report or informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his sentence in doubtfull cases, onely conditionally; if it be the Popes minde: if otherwise, we will be free to recall our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent beliefe. This is all which I can imagine any of you can say for your selues. And may not we, I pray you, say as much, if thus much would serue for vs? Might not we by the selfe same reason teach the people to admit of translations, but onely conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as farre forth as they shall be perswaded that this was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scripture or the word of God? For questionlesse, it is more certaine that God cannot erre, than that the Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. And it is more necessarie vnto Christian beliefe to hold, that God the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost neither can, nor will speake a lie: than that the Pope cannot, or will not teach vs amisse. That the Pope and his Cardinals doe arrogate thus much vnto themselues, is more than the lay and vnlearned people can tell, but onely by yours and others relation: But that the God of heauen neither can, nor will teach amisse, is a principle not controuersed by any that thinkes there is a God.</p>

                           <pb n="243" facs="tcp:7863:147"/>4 Let it then first be granted, That God is freer from errour, from deceiuing, or being deceiued in points of faith, or matters of mans saluation, than the Pope is, although he speake <hi>ex Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra.</hi> From this position it followes most directly, and most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that if the lay vnlearned people of this land haue as good means and better, to know that these bookes of Scripture are Gods owne words, than they can haue to know that this or that Canon in any Councel was confirmed by the Popes teaching <hi>ex Cathedra:</hi> then must the same people beleeue the one more stedfastly than the other; to wit, Gods word, as it is read vnto them in our Church, more stedfastly than the Popes interpretations, iniunctions, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Let vs compare the meanes of knowing both. First, if the Popes decrees be a certaine meanes of knowing any truth: they are as certaine a meanes of knowing those Scriptures which our Church admits, to be Gods word, as of any thing else; for the Pope and his Councell<note n="a" place="margin">Concil. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. sessione quarta.</note> haue auoucht them for such, although they adde some more than we acknowledge.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 If the worst then should fall out that can be imagined; as if we had reason to despaire of all other translations saue only of the Vulgar, yet that it were the word of God we might know, if by no other meanes, yet by consent of the Romish Church; and all the people of this land might be as certaine of this decree, as of any the Pope can giue. But take the same Scripture as it is translated into our English, the people may be as certaine that it is the word of God, as they can be that the Trent-Councell was lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, or by the Pope confirmed, yea much more certaine. The Iesuites may tell them, that these very words (being first englished) were spoken in the Trent-Councell, and confirmed by the Pope. Why should they beleeue it? because they auouch it seriously whom they thinke able to vnderstand Latine? Suppose not onely one, or two, or three, but the whole assembly of our Cleargie tels the same people, that these (reciting the points of our saluation) are the verie words of God himselfe; and are for substance all one in the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, and English. What difference can you heere imagine? That the Trent-Councell decreed thus, the moderne Iesuites haue it but from tradition of this age: That God spake thus, we haue the consent of all ages. Yea, but it is easier to render the Trent-Councels meaning out of Latine,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7863:148"/> than the meaning of Gods word out of Hebrew or Greeke? Whether it be so or no, the vnlearned people cannot tell, but by hearesay: yet, if we would take the vulgar Latine, this foolish ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection were none: for it is as easie to be rendred, as the Trent-Councell; and if the Trent Councell be true, it is the word of God. All then is equall concerning the difficulties, that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the skill, or ignorance of the translators of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Popes decrees, or scripture. Our ministers know to render the meaning of Scripture as well as yours doe the meaning of the Councels. Let vs now see whether it be as likely, that our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters fidelitie in telling them as they are perswaded, and as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue themselues, be not to be presumed as great. To call this in question were extreme impudencie &amp; vnciuilitie, especially seeing we teach, that the people should be throughly instructed in the truth: where as you hold it for good Christian pollicie, to hold thē in ignorance. Our permitting the free vse of Scriptures to all doth free vs from all suspition of imposture or guile: of which in the Iesuite or learned Papist the deniall of like libertie, is a foule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. Further, let vs examine, whether from the matter or manner of the Popes decrees, there can be any argument drawne to perswade the people that these are his decrees and no other mans: more then can be gathered from the matter and manner of Scripture phrase, to perswade a man that these are Gods, &amp; can be no mans words.<note n="a" place="margin">Granting the Pope to be as infallible as God himselfe: yet were not his decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For no man of sense or reason, but must needs suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be perswaded, that it is a farre easier matter to counterfaite the Decrees of the Laterane or Trent-councell, or the Popes writs, interpretations, or determinations: than artificial y to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the inuincible and maiesticall word of God, either for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the manner.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 The sequele is this, that if the Scriptures receiued by vs be obnoxious to any the least suspition of being forged: then from the same reasons, much more lyable to the same suspition are those which we account the Popes decrees, and therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of vs, much lesse to be beleeued; although otherwise we should grant the Popes decrees (which without controuersie were his decrees indeed) to be as infallible as the eternall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable decrees of the Almightie. Gods word oft-times vnto
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7863:148"/> Atheists hath discouerd it selfe by the maiestie of stile and subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of matter, to be more than humane, and therefore diuine, not able to be imitated by any lying Spirit. If any Iesuite will denie this: let him make triall of imitation in the prophecie of <hi>Isaias,</hi> the beginning of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, the relation of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his brethrens dialogues, the booke of <hi>Iob, &amp;c.</hi> The maiestie of speech and other excellencies which appeares in them (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we consider the time, wherein most of them were written,) doth argue a diuine spirit: in whose imitation the most accurate writers of later ages, (albeit no man writes excellently but from some beame of diuine illumination in the facultie) are▪ but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, if we read the same Scriptures in the tongue wherein they were written, or in sundrie moderne tongues capable of the diuine splendor which shines in the originall; with which the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine (especially in prose) hath greatest disproportion of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or copious tongues. As for the Popes Decrees they bewray themselues both for the matter and manner, to be onely humane, and therefore easie to be imitated by the Spirit of man, subiect to many errors. Nor doth the Pope challenge to himselfe the gift of prophecie, but onely of legall decisions: which are no otherwise written, than many write, and containe no deeper nor more super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall matter, than many may inuent: most of them vsually pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a base and barbarous Logicke phrase: his stile at the best is not peculiar, his character easie to be counterfaite by any man that can pen a proclamation, or frame an instrument in ciuill Courts.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 To recollect what hath beene said. First, seeing God is more to be beleeued than men; secondly, seeing we haue better arguments to perswade the people that these Scriptures daily read in our Church, are Gods owne words, than the Priests and Iesuits haue; that the tidings which they bring from beyond Sea are the Popes or Churches decrees or sentence: we may and ought teach them to relie immediately vpon Gods word preached or read vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as the surest and most infallible rule of faith, the most liuely, most effectuall, and most forcible meanes of their saluation. Or if the Iesuites will teach them to beleeue the Popes decrees gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> or the Churches opinion indefinitely taken, <hi>fide diuina,</hi> by infallible faith; but the Iesuites, or Priests expositions or
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7863:149"/> translations of them, only conditionally, and with this limitation, <hi>[If so they be the Pope or Churches decrees]:</hi> we may in like sort with farre greater reason, teach the people to beleeue the Scriptures or the word of God absolutely, and our translations or expositions of it, but conditionally or with limitation, so farre as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the word of God. Seeing it is as probable, that we may expound Gods word as rightly and sincerely, as the other can the Church or Popes edicts: we haue better reason to exact this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall obedience &amp; assent, in the vertue and authoritie of Gods word, which we make the rule of faith; than they can haue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the like obedience by vertue of the Pope or Churches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, which is to them the mistresse of faith. For it is more certaine to any man liuing, that Gods word is most infallibly true, than that the Pope cannot erre. Wherefore, if the absolute beleefe of the Popes infallibilitie, and conditionall beliefe of the Iesuites or Priests his messengers fidelitie or skill, be sufficient to saluation: much more may the absolute beliefe or assent vnto the infallibilitie of Gods word, and such conditionall and limited beliefe of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters fidelitie, be sufficient for the saluation of his people: who as hath bin proued, cannot be more certaine that the Romish Church saith this or that, than we can be of Gods word. For they neuer heare the Church or Pope speak, but in Iesuits or Priests mouthes. And although they knew he said iust so as those say: yet may a man doubt in modestie, whether the Popes words be alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; but of the infallibilitie of Gods word, can no man doubt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 And heere I cannot but much wonder at the preposterous courses of these Romanists, who holding an implicite faith of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing as the Church beleeues, (in many points,) to be sufficient vnto saluation: will yet fasten this implicite faith vpon the present Church of Rome, and not referre it rather vnto that Church as it was vnder S. <hi>Peters</hi> iurisdiction and gouernment. For if vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie be (as they contend) a sure note of vndoubted truth: then must it needs be more vndoubtedly true, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> could not erre in matters of faith, than that this present Romish Pope &amp; his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals cannot so erre. For all Papists hold this as true of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as of this present Pope: and all Protestants hold it true of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> not in the present Pope: and so did all the fathers without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie hold it most true, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> did not teach amisse in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7863:149"/> writings. So that vniuersalitie is much greater for Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> then for this Pope that now is, or the next that shall be.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 For these reasons (fully consonant to their owne positions) all Papists me thinkes, in reason, should make the same difference in their estimate of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and later Popes, which a French Cardinall (as the tradition is at Durham) once made betwixt Saint <hi>Cuthbert</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede.</hi> Albeit S. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was accounted the greater Saint amongst them, whose greater benefactour he had beene, (in which respect they brought the Cardinall first vnto Saint <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> tombe:) yet, because he knew him not so well, but onely by their report, he praies very warily; <hi>Sancte Cuthberte, si Sanctus es, ora pro me.</hi> But, afterwards brought vnto <hi>Bedes</hi> tombe then in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie; because he had beene famous in forraine Nations, from the commendations of lesse partiall antiquity: he fell to his praiers without ifs or ands; <hi>Venerabilis Beda, qui à tu Sanctus es, ora pro me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10 Proportionall to this caution in this French mans prayer, should euery moderne Papist limit his beleefe of the present Popes infallibilitie in respect of S. <hi>Peters;</hi> And say thus in his heart: As for S. <hi>Peter,</hi> I know he beleeued and taught aright; and I beseech God I may beleeue as he beleeued, and that my soule may come whither his is gone: as for this present Pope, if he beleeue as S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did, &amp; be likely to follow him in life &amp; death, I pray God I may beleeue as he beleeues, and do as he teacheth; but otherwise (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me) I would be very loth to pin my beliefe vpon his sleeue, least happily he runne headlong to hell with that which should haue drawne me vp to heauen: for in this life I walke by faith, and by faith I must ascend thither, if euer I come there, and therefore I dare not fasten my beleefe vpon any man, whom I would be loath to follow in his course of life. But most surely might this implicite faith be fastned vpon Gods written word, contained in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Apostles &amp; Euangelists. We know, O Lord, that thou hast taught them all truth that is necessarie for thy Church to know. And our aduersaries confesse, that thy word vttered by them, (righly vnderstood) is the most sure rule of faith: for by this they seeke to establish the infallibilitie of the Church and Pope. They themselues speake aright, by their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, where they speake consonantly vnto it.

Not that the flocke may not refuse to obey their ouerseers, in some cases; but our Apostle did foresee, that the people would be alwaies most prone to disobedience, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon lesse occasions than was requisite: and yet disobedience, vnlesse vpon euident, and iust occasions, he knew to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as blinde obedience in matters vnlawfull; the one vsually is the forerunner of superstition and idolatrie, the other the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of carnall securitie, schisme, and infidelitie. And, according to our Apostles feare, did it fall out in the Church of God. The first mischiefe, which befell her in her prime, was from the want of due reuerence, and awfull regard of Ecclesiasticke iniunctions, and constitutions. Hence did heresies spring in such abundance; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than had sowne their seeds in proud hearts; and the ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates facilitie to countenāce euery prating Discontent, or forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putting Vocalist, in preaching what he list, though contrarie to his gouernours constitutions, was as the spring sunne to cherish and bring them forth. And as the Romish Church, vpon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of such rebellious spirits, did raise her selfe aboue all that is called God: So in truth it cannot be denied, but that many in reformed congregations, by seeking to cure her diseases, haue cast the Church of GOD into a relapse of her former sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: which was the vsurpation of too much libertie in her

There is some peculiar authoritie in the Priesthood, or ministerie, which is not to be found in other men. This authoritie in them is as essentially subordinate to Christ, as the authoritie of any other magistrates is, vnto the principalitie, or soueraigntie, of that nation wherein they liue. Disobedience vnto spirituall gouernours, doth redound as directly and fully vnto Christs, as disobedience to inferiour Magistrates doth vnto the Princes or supreme gouernours dishonour: <hi>For he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Christs messengers heareth him, he that despiseth them despiseth him:</hi> and yet it is as euident againe in some cases they may bee disobeyed.

Things commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden are of three sorts, eyther good in themselues, and required, or else simply bad and prohibited by the law of God or nature; or finally indifferent, neither commanded, nor forbidden by eyther of the former lawes. Againe, of good things, some are better,

Our perswasion of any kind, is then pure, when there is no surmise or perswasion of any contrarie qualitie in the action to be vndertaken; then mixt, when we are partly perswaded, that it is of this or that nature, but not without some surmise or probability, that it may be of another quality.<note n="c" place="margin">Of the various mixture of perswasions, whence the varietie of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions▪ or of doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their lawfulnesse or vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.</note> The mixture of our perswasion likewise may be diuers. Somtimes we may be strongly perswaded, that the matter enioyned is good, &amp; yet haue some weake perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or surmise, that it is euil, or contrariwise. Sometimes we may haue an equal perswasion both waies, &amp; thinke it as probably good as euil.

Sometimes a strong perswasion that it is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, &amp; yet some surmise, that it is a great euill, or great good.

                           </hi> for our present purpose, it will suffice to suppose three degrees of good, and three of euill, and as many of our perswasions concerning the lawfulnesse, vnlawfulnesse, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of our actions.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Of things good in themselues, or so apprehended by vs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any suspition or scruple of euill in them, there is no question. Euery mans conscience hath authoritie sufficient to enioyne their practise, and other authoritie is scarce seene in the substance of such actions. For seeing the good it selfe is to be done, one time or other, in some measure, onely the alacritie of doing it being
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7863:156"/> enioyned; in what time or measure it is to be done, or other like circumstances, doe properly come within the subiect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Concerning pure perswasion of things indifferent likewise, there is no difficultie of moment. For no man that vnderstands what he saith, wil once denie, that euery lawfull gouernour is to be obeyed, in things acknowledged for meerely indifferent. Only this question may be made, Whether indifferent in the general, or vnto many, or most men at ordinarie times, be indifferent in the indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall, to this or that particular man, at some peculiar seasons? Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he makes no conscience of his waies, or else he is besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that denies obedience vnto any lawfull Magistrate: saue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such matters as at that time seeme vnlawfull for him to doe, though indifferent in the generall, or at other seasons, or to other men. Hence ariseth the first degree of difference betwixt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and priuate persons, that in things acknowledged for indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vnto vs, at this very instant, we are not bound to follow pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate mens aduice; but a magistrates or gouernours commaund we are in conscience to obey, and to make choice of whether part he shall appoint.</p>

This falles out onely and alwaies then, when the difference betweene the greatnesse or probabilities of the euill feared in the one, and the goodnesse hoped in the other action, is greater than the quantitie or probabilitie of the former euil, which admitted no mixt apprehension of good. The reason is plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mixture of good doth onely recompense so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of euill as it selfe containes of good. Now if in the actions
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7863:156"/> of equally mixt perswasions, the proportion betweene the euill and good be such, as is betweene eleuen and fiue; the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the euill will be as sixe; and so shall it make the action, wherein it is, worse, than that which hath but fiue degrees or partes of euill, albeit without all mixture of any contrarie perswasion, or conceit of good. But alwaies where the euills feared are equall, and the probabilities of their ensuing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise equall: any mixt apprehension of some good probably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the one, not to the other, doth make that action wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is incident, lesse euill, according to the degrees, eyther of the good apprehended, or of our probabilities that it may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht: and yet shall the action still be euill, as long as the euill which we feare is greater than the good which we can hope for; or, (these being equall) the probabilities greater, that the euill should fal out, than the good. For if to preferre a lesse good before a greater, be euill, much more to aduenture vpon a great euill, in hope of a lesser good; most of all to aduenture vpon any great or probable euill, without probabilitie of any good to counteruaile it in the choice.</p>

Wheresoeuer the probabilities or perswasions of the goodnesse of any action, are as great, as the perswasions and probabilities of the euill that may ensue, and the measure of the goodnesse apprehended, as great as the quantity of the euill feared: a man of his owne priuate accord may as safely aduenture vpon the action, as the omission of it, referring the euēt to Gods prouidence, which fauoureth positiue actions, more than priuations; works rather than idlenesse; and the following of that which is good, more than abstinence from euill. A lawfull go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours command, whether spirituall or temporall, must in this case rule all priuate choyse, eyther for doing or omitting it: the case is all one, as in things meerely indifferent; for heere is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie of perswasions.

                        <p n="8">8 Generall rules in this case are verie hard to be giuen, because the circumstances may be many &amp; diuers. The authoritie may be greater or lesse: so may their dislike that are to performe obedience be of the things enioyned. The iniunction likewise may be more or lesse peremptorie. Sometimes it may seeme to resemble rather an aduice, than absolute command: somtimes rather to adiure, than command: Sometimes the parties in authoritie may be of lesse, &amp; the parties of whom obedience is exacted, of greater reach, and deeper insight in those matters, whereunto obediēce, is enioyned, according to the diuersity of the subiect of obedience, which som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time may be such, wherin men of experience or practize are to be most beleeued, wherein occurrence of iudgements and multitude of voices may argue more truth: Sometimes the subiect of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be matters of abstruse speculation, wherein one man of profound iudgement is more to be belieued, than fiue hundred but of ordinarie capacitie. For as things visible, but farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for matters of abstruse speculation, cannot be discerned by multitude of eyes, but by clearenesse of sight; and as he that could discerne ships in the Carthaginian, from the Lilibae an hauen, saw more than all <hi>Xerxes</hi> Armie could in like distance: so doth it oft fall out, that some one profound iudicious contemplator sees clearely that truth, which all the wits of the same age had not been able without him to discouer. Such men may sinne in obeying authoritie, whereunto others in yeelding obedience, sin not; because they can discerne the vnlawfulnesse of the commaund it selfe better than others. But vnlesse a man can iustly plead this, or some other like peculiar reason or priuiledge, it is a very suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and dangerous case to disobey lawfull authoritie, (whether spirituall or temporall) in such matters as he thinkes others of his owne ranke may with safe conscience obey, or in such matters, whereunto he sees many men, by his owne confession of great iudgement and integritie of life, yeelding obedience with alacrity. For if thus he thinke of them, he cannot but suspect himselfe and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7863:160"/> his perswasions of error; nay he cannot be otherwise perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that the commandement, or publike iniunction of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, is not absolutely against Gods commaundement; for so it could not be obeyed, with safe conscience, by men of skill and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie.<note n="a" place="margin">A certaine rule when au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie may be disobeyed, without whose obseruation disobedience is alwaies more suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than safe.</note> And this I take to be the safest generall rule that can be giuen in this case: Not to consider the particular matters inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with such of their circumstances or consequences as we out of our priuate imaginations conceiue, or feare; so much, as the general forme of publike iniunction, as it indistinctly concerns all.

                              <p>The first mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                           </note> A thing may bee said to bee of faith three waies. First, strictly and properly, That is said to bee <hi>ex fide, of faith,</hi> which is an act or exercise of the habite or vertue of faith, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in GOD, in Christ, or to assent vnto any article in this Creede. In this sense no man I thinke doth vrge this place of our Apostle: <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne.</hi> For then all deeds of charitie should be sinfull, seeing they are no actes or exercises of the habite of faith, but of charitie, which is a distinct habite from faith, according to best Diuines: nor can we properly say, that such works flow from faith, as the fruit doth from the roote, seeing charitie is no branch of faith, but a coaeuall stemme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused sanctifying grace, the common roote to both. Such acts then may be said to bee of faith, onely because the doctrine of faith enioynes them, and the habite or vertue of faith inclines the soule vnto them, &amp; moues charitie vnto the exercise of them. And this is the second sense or meaning of the speech, <hi>ex fide, of faith:</hi> that is, those things are said to be of faith, or to proceed from faith, which are commanded by the doctrine of faith▪ or vnto which we are inclined or moued by the habite or vertue of faith. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it alwaies true, <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith,</hi> in this sense, <hi>is sinne.</hi> For so no recreation, no meriment,<note place="margin">The second.</note> not eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with many other works both of reason and nature, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing meerely indifferent could be truly <hi>of faith:</hi> at the least
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:7863:163"/> at this or that time. How then are not all these sinfull, seeing they are not of faith, in none of the former senses, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of faith, nor enioyned by the doctrine of faith? This neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily enforceth vs to seeke a third significatiō of the former words.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Thirdly then, that is said to be <hi>not of faith,</hi> whatsoeuer is not warrātable by the doctrine of faith,<note place="margin">The third mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely meant by our Apostle.</note> whatsoeuer conscience, or the vertue of faith, being consulted, cannot countenance or allow, but rather disswade. And in this sense, all that may be said to be <hi>ex fide, of faith,</hi> whatsoeuer is warrantable by the doctrine of faith, whatsoeuer faith, conscience, or the law of reason and nature can approue or allow of, either absolutely, or at that present whilest they are vndertaken, albeit they do not enioyne them, or impell vs vnto them (at the least) for that season. As for example; If a man, free from necessarie imployments of his calling, should ride halfe a score of miles to be merrie with his honest friend: This were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an act of faith, nor an exercise enioyned by faith, and yet truly <hi>of faith</hi> in our Apostles sense, and no way sinfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause warrantable by the doctrine of faith: Neyther faith, nor conscience, nor lawe of nature would condemne him for so doing. But if his dearest friend lay on his death bed, and did expect some comfort by his presence: his absence v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon such light occasions would be sinfull, because it could not be <hi>of faith.</hi> Neyther the doctrine of faith, nor the law of reason, could countenance such an action. Such resolutions may properly be said <hi>Not of faith,</hi> because they cannot proceed but from some incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or disposition, opposite to the habite of true faith, and the dictates of naturall well disposed, much more of sanctified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Suppose some mans conscience were so scrupulous, as to doubt whether he might ride so farre to be merrie with his friend, when he had no vrgent occasions to withdraw him; and another so confident, and fully perswaded in his mind, as to make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether he should meete his friend in a plaguie house, or when his owne father lay a dying. The question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two doth sinne the more? or if both doe not sin, whether of them is freed from sinne, and by what meanes? The former, as is supposed, doubts of the action, and yet doth it: the other doth the like, but worse, and doubteth not. If that iourney
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7863:163"/> which in it selfe is lawfull, (supposing the former case) becomes vnlawfull to the one, because hee doubts it is vnlawfull: then may the others confident perswasion make his expedition law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him, although in it selfe (supposing the case aboue mentioned) it were vnlawfull. For who can giue any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why confidence of perswasion may not as well legitimate what otherwise is vnlawfull, as doubt or scruple illegitimate that which otherwile were lawfull and warrantable. So that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to these grounds, the former partie aboue mentioned should sinne, not the later. And our Apostles speeches (vnlesse they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some restraint,) will inferre thus much.<note n="*" place="margin">

To proceede then with our Apostles rule. Were it vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally to be vnderstood, it would bring all Christian soules into such perpetuall, miserable, inextricable perplexities, as they should alwaies liue in suspence, and scarce resolue vpon any thing. For his rule holds as true in the omission of what should be done, as in the commission of what we thinke should not be done. Suppose then thy Pastor commaunds thee to obey in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which he verily thinkes, eyther necessarie to be vndertaken by all Christians, at all or most times; or else most expedient for thy soules health, the setting forth of Gods glorie, or the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, at this present. But thou art contrarie-minded, and doubtest
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7863:164"/> whether thou maist doe it lawfully or no.

Or if thou thinkest thou hast some generall warrant for disobedience, because thou supposest this particular to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: yet how canst thou but doubt, whether thou hast learned the precepts of Christian modestie as thou shouldest? Whether thou hast learned to denie thy selfe, and thy affections? whether thou hast learned to reuerence thy Pastor as Gods messenger, not taking any offence at his person? Finally, whether thou hast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all such delights and desires, as vsually are the grounds of false perswasion, and impediments of sincere obedience? If thou canst not be fully and truly resolued in these, then must thou doubt, (whether thou wilt or no) whether thy doubt or scruple it selfe be of faith or conscience, or of humour onely. And if thou canst not but doubt herein, then maist thou assure thy selfe, that thy deniall of obedience is not of faith, and therefore sinfull: if the Apostles rule (as thou supposest) were vniuersally true; that whosoeuer doth any thing, of whose lawfulnesse he doubts, doth sinne, because he doth it not <hi>of faith.</hi>

For the euill which vpon great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater, than any good pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to ensue vpon their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> that they of whom he speakes, did sinne in eating when they doubted. For if they had beene as fully perswaded in their mindes, as the Apostle himselfe, and sundrie others of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were, they had not sinned in eating the selfe same meat: yet for all this they sinned not in eating (simply) when they doubted, but in eating such meates when they doubted: Other meats they might haue eaten with little or no offence; albeit with more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, whether it had been better for them to eate or no. Nor was it so much a positiue doubt, as rather a rashnesse, or want of setled resolution, in many of thē, which made them sin; as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare from the circumstance of the place: yet was this eating not only a sin, but a most grieuous sin, in all that did eate such meats, without a constant and well-grounded resolution. Both the sin, &amp; the extraordinarie grieuousnesse of it did hence, arise: they had eatē of things sacrificed to Idols, or other meats, (in their iudgement) accursed by the law, which they suspected not onely to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be eaten, but doubted whether in eating them they should not be partakers of the table of Diuels, initiate to the Sacraments of idolatrie, or separated from the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, or finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Apostata's from faith, and the holy doctrine. As on the one side, the euill which they feared was extraordinarily grieuous, and the reasons of their feare such as could not easily be cast off, but
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7863:165"/> would be alwaies likely to breed despaire after the action were past, albeit many of them did shake off all doubt for the present: so on the other part, there was not <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> not the least possible surmise of performing any degree of any good or acceptable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the sight of God, by their eating. For, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the same place notes: <hi>The Kingdome of God is not meate or drinke, but righteousnesse and peace; whosoeuer in these,</hi> (as if he had said, not in eating and drinking) <hi>serueth Christ, is acceptable vnto God, and is approued of men.</hi> Those then of whom he there spake, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it a chiefe part of their righteousnesse to abstaine from all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane things, their danger in eating was in quantitie exceeding great, and for the qualitie spirituall: their losse in abstaining from such meates (being prouided of others) was in quantitie as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and for the qualitie meerely corporall. Wherefore thus to haue eaten, with the least scruple of such grieuous danger, was worse than <hi>Esau's</hi> alienating of his birth-right for a messe of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And albeit they had doubted to day, and growne resolute to morrow, vpon no better motiues than the bare examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or in an humour or brauerie, because they would not doubt any longer, but vse their libertie as others did: yet had such resolutions beene deadly. For opinions of this nature may not bee cast off in a moment, nor may a man aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon a doubt of such fearefull consequence, but vpon great motiues of some spirituall good; the probabilities of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which may counteruaile the euill feared: or vpon serious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, and perspicuous discouerie of their former errour, and causelesse scruple. From these grounds did our Apostle inferre that exhortation. <hi>Let euery man be fully perswaded in his mind.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

For such resolutions, albeit they may seeme most strong, as indeed they are for the time exceeding stiffe: yet are they easily to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminded by Sathan; the inward temptations of the flesh; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occurrents; and after once they begin to faile, such as leane
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7863:166"/> most vnto them, fall so much the more headlong into deepest des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, by how much they haue beene stronger or higher pitcht; as it seems some of these, to whom he writes, had beene too bold in eatng, and were afterwards tortured by the sting of conscience. The end of our Apostles exhortation was this: Seeing their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, concerning the vnlawfulnesse of such meates, had beene (as it were) bred vp with the parties doubting, they should in no case aduenture vpon the contrarie practise, but vpon long and well-setled resolution, grounded vpon a sincere and cleere manifestation of their former errour. For as the Phisitions of our bodies do not alwaies apply such medicines, as they know most forcible to expell the present disease, if the same be contrarie to our former long accustomed diet, (for <hi>vitiosae consuetudini indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum est,</hi> there must a care be had that a custome, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, be not too violently thwarted, or too sodainly broken off:) so likewise must skilfull Physitions, of the soule, not seeke so much to expell inueterate opinions, (though erroneous,) by present force of strongest arguments, or eager exhortations; but rather suffer them to weare out their strength by little and little, neuer infusing contrarie perswasions, but mitigated and qualified, and that sparingly, as opportunitie shall serue.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7863:167"/> eyther absolutely euill, or else a farre lesse good, which in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the greater good is likewise to bee accounted euill. Now, if whatsoeuer be not of faith be a sinne, then by the former rules it is a sinne, because a lesse good is preferred before a greater, or some euill chosen without any proportionable good, that might serue as a sufficient recompence. But if the nature of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sinne consist in one of these two: It is questionable, how or in what case, doubting or scruple of what we do, doth make our actions sinfull.<note n="a" place="margin">How scruples or doubt of what we doe, concurre to make our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sinfull.</note> Briefely, it is an externall cause, or circumstance, concurring to the making of a sinfull action, not any essentiall part, or internall circumstance of the sinne it selfe once caused. And it thus concurres onely, when that which in it selfe is euill, or proues so in the euent, would not be euill vnto vs, vnlesse we had some doubt or scruple, that is, some notice or apprehension of it as euill: In such cases indeed we should not sinne, vnlesse we had formerly doubted: but to speake exactly, we doe not sin, because we doe what we doubt of, but because in doing<note n="b" place="margin">As when the euill feared, is greater than any good that can be hoped.</note> some actions, when we doubt, we actually preferre euill before good; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we should not, albeit we did the selfe same action. For it could not be euill to vs, without the apprehension of its nature, so as the apprehension of it concurres to the making of it euill. And because in all doubts or scruples, there is some apprehension of euill: therefore when we doubt, in cases aboue mentioned our actions are not of faith, but sinfull. But if eyther we could be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded to the contrarie; that is, if we could out of sinceritie of conscience, &amp; setled iudgement, discerne that very thing which eyther we ourselues sometimes did, or others yet, apprehend as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, not to be truly euill: the same action, which before had beene, shall not be now sinfull vnto vs: because we now preferre not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill before good. Or againe, albeit the thing were in it selfe euill, (as being prohibited by some positiue law,) but we vpon inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or vnculpable ignorance, did not apprehend it for such: wee should not actually sin in doing it, because in this case, wee could not truly be censured for preferring euill before good (seeing the apprehension maketh it euill to vs) albeit we did prefer that which was euill, before that which was good. As for example: If a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite should haue eaten swines flesh, being altogether ignorant (not by his owne, but the Priests negligence) of the Israelites law to the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7863:168"/> contrarie: he had done that which was euill, because forbidden by the law, but not<note n="b" place="margin">Malum non malè.</note> ill, because he had no apprehension of it as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but did eate it without all scruple, as well as the strong in faith did in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time. As doubting, in those cases wherein wee haue an apprehension of some excesse of euill, makes mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not to be of faith; and want of doubt, (so all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be obserued) makes them to be according vnto faith:<note n="*" place="margin">The same action though simply euill in both, may be lesse <hi>of faith</hi> in him that doth it confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, then in another that doth it not without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> so it oft-times falles out, that such as nothing doubt whether they do ill or no, do sinne farre more than such, as not without great scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conscience make the same sinister choyce. For, oft-times the causes why men make no scruple, or why they apprehend not the euill which they doe, are such, as will necessarily make their actions worse, than if they had doubted, and yet had done the same. This rule holds alwaies true, when the cause, why men doubt not of their actions, is some inordinate desire of gaine, pleasure, or other like corrupt affection, or some strong humour of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: not stedfast or well-grounded resolution, not pure simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, or inuincible ignorance, not occasioned by default or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our vocation. If scruple eyther hath not beene concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or else expelled vpon these later motiues, our actions are thereby iustifiable or excusable: but where strength of inordinate affection or desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2 The best methode to square our actions to the rule of faith, would be this. First, to be rightly instructed and perswaded in what order, or ranke of goodnesse, obedience to spirituall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ought to be placed. Secondly, (hauing found out the true
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7863:169"/> nature and qualitie, and due estimation of obedience in generall,) to accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t the degrees of goodnesse, which appeare in this or that particular act of obedience. And these are to be taken, according to the generalitie, or soueraigntie of the authoritie commanding, or according to the manner, and tenour of the command, or charge it selfe; as, those commands are to be obeyed with more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie, (although they proceed from the same, or equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,) in which obedience is demanded vpon stricter, or more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring termes, or wherein the zealous desires of men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are eyther more fully and significantly expressed to all, or more liuely intimated vnto vs in particular.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Thirdly, to calculate the inconuenience, or scandales that may arise from our disobedience. For albeit we might denie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in sundrie particulars, with farre safer consciences than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could, yea, although it were indifferent for vs (as perhaps in diuers cases it is to some men) to performe or denie obedience:<note n="a" place="margin">This is a point, which I am perswaded, many haue lesse regarded than had been requisite, as not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that our Apostles rule might be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as well by the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as by the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others. or that the same offence might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to weake and tender consciences, by embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to denie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as was giuen in our Apostles time, by embolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to eate of things suspected for vnlawfull Nor can we doubt but many in our time haue made scruple of matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full account, onely from the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom they reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> yet we should alwaies haue an especiall care, that we embolden not others, (who haue not the like motiues, or cannot be so well perswaded) to doe the like, by our example. For so we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the selfe same sinne, which they that were strong in faith did, by causing others to eate such meates, as they eyther made scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of before they eate, or else were vpbraided by their consciences after they had eaten: And (as I intimated before) vnlesse disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be vpon euident, and well grounded resolutions, it is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="4">4 Lastly, we are diligently to consider the hopes, or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of goodnesse eyther inherent, or consequent to the actions themselues, which are to be vndertaken.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 All these considerations must be put in opposite ballance to our doubts, or feares of euill, whether inherent or consequent to the same actions, or matters inioyned, if we were left to our owne choice; or to the probabilities, or iealousies, which we may haue,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7863:169"/> that the forme of publike commaund is contrarie to Gods law. Although for doubts or scruples conceiued out of priuate dislike to the things inioyned, onely because we see no expresse warrant for them out of Scripture, or because they goe against our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: we need not so much to oppose former considerations, to ouersway thē, as seeke to extirpate thē. For after the interpositiō of authority, we may rather suspect that these doubts are not of faith, but of humour, vnlesse we can deriue them from some opposition, betwixt the publike edicts inioyning obedience, and the law of God, which must be presumed to countenance, as long as it doth not contradict, superiours actions, because it giues authoritie and commission to make them. Euery doubt, or scruple, that such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts are formally or directly contrarie to Gods law, is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to denie obedience vnto them: nor doe spiritual Gouernours, in demanding obedience to such as their inferiours suspect to bee against Gods law, oppose humane authoritie to diuine, or desire men to obey them rather than God, as some friuolously haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Indeed the least probabilitie or suspition of disobeying God, should make vs refuse to obey man, in case our disobedience vnto man redounded onely to man, and not to God. But in as much as Christ hath said, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth mee,</hi> disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto spirituall gouernours is disobedience vnto Christ, yea vnto God. And therefore obedience may not be denied vnto such, but vpon great and waightie motiues, and serious examination of such reasons, as moue vs to thinke, that their edicts are contrarie, or opposite to Gods lawes. Otherwise we should preferre a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturall conceit, or surmise of obeying God rather than man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a greater probabilitie of obeying God by obeying man. For it is certaine in general, that men in spirituall authoritie should be obeyed, and that in obeying them we obey God: but vncertaine and coniecturall, (according to our supposition) whether in this particular they should be disobeyed, and therefore vncertaine, whether God, by our deniall of obedience, should bee disobeyed or obeyed.</p>

Most certaine we are, that they must be obeyed in all lawfull cases, or where their lawes are not opposite vnto Gods: and if wee were certaine, that theirs were contrarie to Gods lawes, we are as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, by the doctrine of faith, that they should bee disobeyed. But when we doubt whether their degrees be against Gods lawes, we cannot but doubt, and doubting feare, least we should disobey God directly in obeying them. And by the former reasons, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, that if the doubt were equall on both sides; that is, were it as probable that their cōmands are against Gods as not▪ we were bound in conscience not to obey thē; because we shold commit a greater sin in obeying them, if they were indeed opposite, than we should in disobeying them, supposing they were not opposite or contrarie to Gods lawes. For in the one case we should disobey Gods lawes directly and immediately: in the other only mediately,

And questionlesse if men did infallibly beleeue, or absolutely from their hearts obey, that which they vndoubtedly know to be Gods will: they would neuer make question, but that, for which they haue presumptions that it is part of Gods will, or that, which is commended vnto them for his will, by such as he hath appointed to be messengers of the same, should be conditionally beleeued, and with caution obeyed, especially when it is deliuered solemnly vpon deliberation, &amp; premeditatiō or out of that place whence he hath appointed thē to learne his wil. <hi>Did not Priests</hi> (as the Prouerb is) <hi>forget that euer they were Clearkes,</hi> or such as take themselues for great proficients, that they were sometimes Nouices in the schole of Christ: they might remember how they came vnto that absolute and infallible beliefe of those Christian principles, by which they hope for saluation, by entertaining this conditional beliefe, which we speake of, and by yeelding like obedience vnto diuine truthes, now fully, but at the first imperfectly, knowne for such. And albeit such generall articles of Christian faith, as are necessarie for all to beleeue, neither increase, nor diminish their number: yet if we des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vnto the diuersitie of mens estates and callings, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of time and place: Christian faith receiueth perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, not onely in it proper strength, or as we say by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but in extent also vnto many particulars, eyther directly contained (though not so easie to be discerned) as essentiall parts vnder the former generall principles, or else annexed vnto them collaterally as limmes or borders. Besides, all Christian duties, or matters of practise, are not promiscuously fit for euery time or place, but must be seuerally proportioned to their diuersitie. Againe, the same duties, (I meane of the same kinde) must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in different measure, according to the different exigence of time, place, persons, or other occurrents. In all these and many more respects is this conditionall assent, and obedience vnto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors

And ere men can retaine stedfastly that which is best, they must make triall of all, or many things of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds: and yet triall of spirituall medicines without spirituall Physitiōs prescripts, is so much more dangerous to ordinary mens soules, than like triall of Phisicke-conclusions is to their bodies, by how much such men are more ignorant of the state of their soules, than of their bodies.

                        <p n="2">2 Nor doth the greater stedfastnesse, or infallibilitie of the point beleeued necessarily, exact either obedience of an higher nature, or more intention, or alacritie in the act, than may without offence
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7863:173"/> be performed, vnto some other points of doctrine lesse infallible, or lesse euident to their consciences, who must obey. Infallibilitie of it selfe exactes only a more full and absolute title ouer our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, than probabilities or presumptions can expect. For that which is infallible, and absolutely beleeued for a diuine truth, exacts such obedience, (both for qualitie and degree,) as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the nature of the thing proposed, without all limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, condition, or reseruation: that is, perpetuall and absolute allegeance. That which is but probably, or conditionally assented vnto as diuine truth, (Whatsoeuer the nature of the thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the end or consequence pretended, or exigences of other circumstances be,) can exact onely conditionall, or cautionarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: yet obedience, for the qualitie, sutable to the nature of the thing proposed, and for the alacritie, or intention of the act, proportionable to the end or consequence pretended, and auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by Gods Embassadors. So that if they commend it vnto vs, as fit to be entertained in some higher rancke of goodnesse, or as most necessarie for the present time, albeit we our selues doe not apprehend the same as expresly commaunded by God: yet may we performe obedience, both as sincere for the qualitie, and entire for degree, as we doe vnto some other things, which we stedfastly beleeue to be commanded in Gods word. But wee must not tender our obedience vnder the same stile or title. Absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, of what kinde soeuer, we may not yeeld vnto it, vntill it be absolutely knowne for Gods will. When it is once knowne for such, we must absolutely yeeld vp the same obedience, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was but conditionally yeelded: as a man may pay the same summe vpon caution, before hee be throughly perswaded of the demaunders right vnto it, which after his right be fully knowne, he paies absolutely.

                        <p n="4">4 The act or qualitie of our obedience, (so we be more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perswaded that it is Gods word, than otherwise, or know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrarie) must be proportioned to the title, or nature of the thing proposed, which is commended vnto vs as a spirituall good. So that our obedience must be religious and spirituall, not meerely ciuil: although our best motiue, why we hold it to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracle, or spirituall good, be the authoritie of our teacher, which is but humaine; but now he exacts not obedience to his owne authoritie, but vnto Gods word, (as he affirmes:) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know is diuine, therefore we must yeeld religious, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it; and therefore religious, albeit conditionall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto this precept, which we probably know to be diuine, and assent vnto conditionally as such. The act of our obedience in this particular, must proceed from the same habite, from which our actes of obedience vnto such truthes, as we infallibly beleeue for diuine, doe: for euen this verie act, is performed primarily and absolutely to Gods word in generall, vnto which we owe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and spirituall obedience: and vnto this particular (inioyned by our Pastor) onely secondarily, and vpon supposition that it is part of Gods word. So as if the particular by him inioyned, should in the euent proue no part of Gods word: yet obeying it onely vpon the former motiues, it might be truly said, we had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed Gods word, not it; as he that shewes kindnesse to a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, vpon presumption that he is a brother or alliance of his deare and familiar friend, albeit he were mistaken herein, may be said to haue done a friendly office rather to his knowne acquaintance, for whose sake he vsed the stranger kindly, than vnto the stranger himselfe thus kindly vsed vpon a mistake. But albeit the qualitie be such, as Gods word absolutely knowne requires: yet the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our obedience must be limited by the degrees of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or morall certaintie, which we haue of this particular, that it is Gods Oracle. Where the probabilities are lesse, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements for beliefe of this particular weaker, there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our assent, and reseruation of our obedience must bee more expresse: that is, we must stand further off from yeelding absolute, and be more inclined to renounce this present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioniall obedience (which we yet performe,) vpon lesser motiues
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7863:174"/> to the contrarie, then we would, if our probabilities for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it were greater. Where the probabilities, or inducements for beleefe of this particular, are greater and stronger, there wee must the more incline vnto absolute and irreuocable obedience, or assent vnto the same particular: and be more vnreadie, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to recall our assent, or renounce our obedience, but vpon greater and more euident reasons. Onely there we are to fixe our beliefe absolutely; onely there we may safely, vndoubtedly, and fully passe ouer our full and absolute obedience vnto it, without all condition, limitation of time, or reseruation: when the truth of it shall be as fully confirmed, and manifested to our consciences, as the others are, vnto which we haue formerly yeelded absolute obedience, without appeale or reseruation: or when wee can as clearely discerne, and as stedfastly beleeue, the consonancie of this particular with the formers, as wee can the formers with Gods word.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And whereas we said before, that the onely motiues which some men haue to beleeue the sense and meaning of sundrie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, (necessarie perhaps vnto them in particular at some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, when God shall call them to some extraordinarie point of obedience) might be the authoritie of their teachers: this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie may bee greater or lesse, according to the qualitie of the Minister or spirituall Gouernour. As the world goes now a daies, this function is committed to some, in whose mouth the word of God, or any good doctrine, may rather seeme to lose its vertue and power, than his any way binde men to obedience, vnlesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his commendation of what hee proposeth, they haue other motiues to perswade them, that it is Gods word, or wholesome doctrine. If the minister, who should carrie Gods message, be such a one as Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> iested vpon, <hi>That he would not for any good heare him say the Creed, lest he should take it for a lie comming out of his mouth:</hi> It is doubtfull what the people should do in such a case, albeit he exact obedience vpon their vow in Baptisme, if they haue no other motiue but his authoritie. Yet for all this, it is not best to be too bold in contemning his admonitions, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurations, vnlesse they be apparantly false. In this case others more sincere and skilfull, or such as haue authoritie to examine his doctrine, should be consulted, his may not be neglected in all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7863:174"/> particulars, vpon a generall preiudice of his lewdnesse or simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. For though his life be bad, yet may his meditations for that present, wherein he publikely speakes, be good and fruitfull vnto them, so they will yeeld due obedience to his doctrine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man should know a Constable, or some greater Officer, that pretends commission from the King, to be a notorious lying knaue, or treacherous companion: yet were it not the safest way to tell him he lied, when he charged him to obey him in the Kings name, nor to make a scoffe of his authoritie, or replie he would not beleeue he had any, because he might abuse himselfe, and it at other times: If so he doe at this time, he may answere it before his betters hereafter: but in the meane while, it were best for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie commanded to obey him, vntill he be certaine, that he did ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faine authoritie, where he had none, or else abuse it in this particular. He that should yeeld obedience, being thus (perhaps wrongfully) charged in the Kings name, (so hee yeeld it for this reason, &amp; vpon this condition:) shal not be thought guiltie of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie, albeit he be hereby brought to commit some fact, distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to his Maiestie, or publike peace. For the fault in this case, must be returned vpon the Author: if so the partie obeying did not know it to bee simply vnlawful, and against the Kings peace, or had no opportunity of consulting other publike Officers, but hath beene abused, by the craft and cunning of the other, who hath concealed his end, intention, or other circumstance which made the fact vnlawfull. It is enough to disclaime his former obedience when he knowes the truth. And if Officers should not be obeyed in the Kings name, vntill men sought the truth, whether they had a lawfull commission, or but a counterfait, or whether they did not goe beyond their commission: the Kings Maiestie should want a great deale of necessarie seruice, and the Common-weale bee at an ill passe for continuance of publike peace. Did most men feare God, as much as men, or the sonne of man, the Iudge of quicke and dead, as much as earthly Iudges: they would not so often withdraw their necke from the yoake of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian obedience, (being charged to vndertake it in Christs name, and as they would answere it at that dreadfull day,) vpon such sillie exceptions against the meanenesse, basenesse, or lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Ministers person. Bee hee as they list to make
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7863:175"/> him for his life, it hath pleased God to make him his messenger, his officer to demaund obedience of them. And shall it serue their turne to say, we will not beleeue that God sent him with this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, or sure he goes beyond his commission: when they know nothing to the contrarie; but onely will take occasion from his person, to discredite his doctrine, if it controll them in the pursuit of worldly affaires? And God knowes for whose sake it is: wee all may feare, it is especially for the infidelity &amp; disloialty of this people towards him, &amp; their disobedience to his messengers, that he sends them such idle, foolish, or lewd Pastors, as they haue in many places. Because the Laitie of this land are so prone and headstrong to cast off Christes yoake, and to denie due obedience to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers: he therefore sets such watchmen ouer them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, as they shall haue no lust to obey in any thing that they shall propose vnto them, but harden their hearts in infidelitie and disobedience. Albeit I should prosecute this point a great deale further, I should not much digresse from my maine purpose and drift, which God he knowes is no other, but to bring home sillie soules from yeelding this blinde obedience to the Romaine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine yoke. For the diuerting of which from this lands &amp; peoples neckes, I know no better meanes, than to take vp Christs yoake vpon vs. For questionlesse, this open malapert scoffing disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Ecclesiasticke power now openly professed by the meanest, and countenanced by many great ones of the Laitie, is the sinne, which to all that know Gods iudgements, or haue beene obseruant to looke into the daies of our visitation, cries lowdest in the Almghties eares, (more lowd by much than Fryars, Monkes, and Iesuites prayers doe,) for Gods vengeance vpon this land: for vengeance to be executed by no other than our sworne, inueterate, malitious enemies; by no other grieuances, than by the doubled grieuances of the long enraged Romanistes iron-yoake, which is now prepared for vs ten times more heauie and irksome, than was that which our forefathers haue borne. It were hard to determine, whether Atheisme &amp; Infidelitie amongst professed Prorestants, or superstition and Idolatrie amongst the Papists, haue more increased throughout this land in later yeares: or, whether the Romish Priests and Iesuites haue beene mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:7863:176"/> did consist onely in words, and required no other obedience, than a formall speculatiue assent vnto their generall doctrine, not a full resignation of mens willes, or heartie submission of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnto such rules as they shal prescribe, for the preseruation of a good and vpright conscience in particular actions, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of humane affaires. Or if one of a thousand will be so good as to grant that he is to obey the precepts of Christ, before the customes of our common law, or other ciuill courts: yet euen the best of such, when it comes to points of priuate commoditie, will dispense with his Pastor, and replie: I would doe as you admonish me, if I saw any expresse commaund for it in Gods word, or any euidēt necessity that should bind me to renounce that right which law doth giue me: but for ought I can perceiue, I may prosecute my right in this present case, with a safe conscience, and you doe not know all particular circumstances, which belong vnto this matter; if you did, or were in my case, I am perswaded you would be of my mind. This although it be the only shelter, vnder which the infidelitie of later ages takes its rest, the onely dorture where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hypocrisie sleepes profoundly, &amp; neuer dreames of further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: yet is it a most sillie excuse, and shamelesse Apologie, in the iudgement of any that knowes, or knowing rightly esteemes, the principles of Christianitie. For, suppose thou see no euidence, that Christ hath commanded thee to confesse his name in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, doth the law lay any necessitie vpon thee, to make thee prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thy supposed right? If it did charge thee vpon paine of death so to doe, thou hast some pretence to obey it; albeit thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest feare him more, that could condemne thee, and the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, to euerlasting death: but the law doth leaue it to thy choise, whether thou wilt vse the benefit of it, or no: and thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour vpon penaltie of incurring Christs displeasure, commaunds thee, that thou vse it not. Thou repliest, thou seest no euidence that Christ commands thee. But doest thou absolutely and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly know, that he doth not call thee at this time, to trie thine obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this particular? If thou canst out of sinceritie of heart, and euidence of truth, fully informe thy conscience in this negatiue (so the end of thy proceedings be good,) thou maist be the bolder to disclaime thy Pastors summons. If thou canst not, how wilt thou answere thy Iudge, when thou shalt appeare before him, why
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:7863:176"/> thou out of the stubbornesse of thy heart, didst more respect thy priuate gaine, than his heauiest displeasure? For suppose thy hope of gaine were great, (as it is vsually to such as thou art more great than certaine) yet cannot the greatnesse, and certaintie of it, counteruaile the least danger of incurring his wrath, nor could the certaintie of worldly gaine coūterpoise, much lesse ouersway, the least surmise or probabilitie of incurring thy soules destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vnlesse thy minde had beene set more on gold, than vpon thy God, more inclined to priuate commoditie and selfe-loue, than vnto Christ thy Redeemer. Or shall thy answere stand for good in his sight, when thou shalt say vnto his messenger: It is more then I know, that Christ commands mee? Then should the damned be iustified at the day of iudgement, when they shall truly replie, they knew not that euer Christ did supplicate vnto them <hi>sub forma pauperis?</hi> Most of them we may safely sweare, had lesse probabilities to beleeue this in their life time, than thou hast now to perswade thee of this particular: although thy Pastors authoritie, and frequent admonitions were set aside; which make thee so much the more inexcusable. For thou mightest haue knowne by him, that God had commanded thee as much, vnlesse thy bad desires had made thee blinde. But neither shal theirs, or thy ignorance herein helpe. For ignorance which is bred of bad desires, corrupt affections, or greedy appetites, brings forth hardnesse of heart, &amp; infidelitie: so that seeing thou shalt not see, &amp; hearing thou shalt not heare, nor vnderstand the warnings for thy peace; because thou hast formerly shut thine eares at thy Pastors admonitions, or raged at his iust reproofe. And the law of God binds thy soule, vpon greater penaltie, &amp; better hopes, than all lawes in the world besides could binde thy bodie, euen vpon hope of euerlasting life, and penaltie of euerlasting death, to lay aside all selfe-loue, all worldly desire, for the finding out of the true sense and meaning of it, as well as to obey it, when thou knowest it. And when any point of doctrine or practise, either in generall or particular, is commended to thee by thy Pastor, Gods word doth binde thee to search, with all sobrietie and modestie, the truth and force of all motiues, inducements, or probabilities which he shall suggest vnto thee; all priuate respect laid aside, least thou become a partiall Iudge of euill thoughts: and if thou
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:7863:177"/> canst not finde better resolution, it bindes thee to relie vpon his authoritie. And euen in this againe, Gods word (so perfect a rule is it) doth rule thy thoughts, to discerne the fidelitie, sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or authoritie of thy teacher.</p>

Generally, vnto such as, in their liues, expresse those characterrs of faithfull dispensers, set downe by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Pen-men of Gods word, euery Auditor is bound to yeeld greater obedience, than vnto others, in points wherein he hath no other motiues to beleeue, beside his Pastors authoritie. For this is a dictate of common reason, and cannot but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the assent of euerie sanctified mind; That such men are most likely to haue the meaning of Gods Spirit, which walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods Spirit, and seeke not their owne gaine, glorie, or pleasure, but Christs glory, his will, and peoples good: and such againe are most likely to vse greatest sinceritie in deliuering the truth, which they know, without partialitie or respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Againe, men are bound <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> to beleeue them best, and obey them most, of whose skill, and sinceritie in dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the mysteries of faith, they haue had most comfortable, and spirituall experience. For the article of Gods prouidence binds vs hereto, and willes vs to reuerence our fathers in Christ, eyther such as (by his word) first begot faith, or nourished it in vs, more than others.</p>
                        <p>Thus much concerning this point, I haue thought good to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in this place, because the true and sincere practise of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, according to that measure of truth, or beliefe which men haue, though but imperfect, is the excellentest meanes, for attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cleare sight of diuine truth, and that perfect measure of sanctifying beliefe, which in this life can bee looked for, as shall (God willing) afterwards appeare.</p>

Our assent vnto many articles of faith, is actually,<note place="margin">What impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith is.</note> and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly absolute. The implicite beliefe of the Romanists is but poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, or rather vertually, and implicitely absolute: This condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall beliefe, hitherto mentioned, not so much as potentially, much lesse implicitely, or virtually absolute. That properly is beleeued by an implicite faith, which is not actually, and expresly assented vnto in the particular: but yet is so essentially and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately contained in some generall article, or point of faith abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely or expresly beleeued, that this particular likewise is assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto in grosse, whilest we assent to it, and may be as absolutely as expresly, and distinctly assented vnto, as the generall, when it is once explicated and vnfolded. In this sense we say, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is implicitely contained in the premisses, the corallarie in the Thaeoreme, or the immediate consequent in his necessarie ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. For he that grants one of these absolutely, must vpon the same termes grant the other, at the first proposall of it vnto him. But this conditionall, or reseruatiue beliefe may be of such points, as are not certainly, &amp; infallibly cōtained in any principle of faith, absolutely, expresly, actually, or infallibly acknowledged; much lesse so essentially, and immediately contained in any, that a man cannot absolutely grant it, but he must absolutely beleeue them. And albeit oft-times, they may be infallibly deduced from known vndoubted principles of faith, yet is not the deduction so imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7863:178"/> as can be made cleare, and euident to all capacities, at least not at the first sight, without any further increase of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in spirituall matters. And before the deduction be made as euident, and apprehended as infallible, as are the generall articles whence they are deduced, the particulars deduced from them may not be so infallibly and absolutely beleeued, as the generals are. The Papists, besides their explicite beleefe of some few maine points, demaund an implicite beliefe of as many particulars as the Church shall propose: so as whatsoeuer the Church shall propose, with them once proposed, admits no cōditional beliefe: all must be absolute, albeit the parties beleeuing cannot discerne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessarie, or probable deduction of the particulars, from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points absolutely &amp; expresly beleeued. It is enough that they know them to be proposed by the Church. For once beleeuing, <hi>Whatsoeuer the Church saith is most infallible,</hi> (which is the maine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Romane faith,) no man can denie any particular proposed by it to bee infallible, more than he can denie the conclusion for certaine, after he hath granted the premisses for such. Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to these positions, they make the visible Church the rule and<note n="a" place="margin">A speech well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the great whore.</note> mistresse of mens faith, as they speake. For albeit a man at this present thinke otherwise of many points of greatest moment, than the Church or Pope doth, or though he thinke not at all of many things, which they in time may propose vnto him: yet after they haue proposed, either a contrary opinion to that which his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels him is Gods word, or a new &amp; strange position, which he neuer thought of, he must without more adoe, beleeue both abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and expresly, and so finally, retract, extend, enlarge, a bridge direct and frame his faith, according to that rule or standard, which they shall set him.<note place="margin">That the faith of moderne Papists cannot be resolued into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or the first truth.</note> Hence (God willing) shall appeare the madnesse of some great schollers among them, who holding the Church to be such a rule of faith, would perswade vs, (if we would be so simple,) that their last resolution of faith is, not into the Churches authoritie, but into the Scripture. For nothing can be resolued beyond it rule, &amp; to make the Churches authoritie such an absolute, authenticke, vnquestionable rule of faith, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do, and withall to seeke the resolution of any point of faith further then it, or to deriue it from Scripture, doth argue such a medley of folly and impietie, as if some gullish Gentleman, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7863:178"/> to proue the antiquitie of his house, should draw his pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from <hi>Adams</hi> great grandfather, and yet hold the records of <hi>Moses</hi> for most vndoubted and true, which affirme <hi>Adam</hi> to haue beene the first progenitour of all mankinde. Whether they seeke to resolue their faith into the Scriptures acknowledged by vs and them, or into other vnwrittē reuelatiōs, pretended for diuine truthes, their folly will still appeare the same, so long as they hold that impious and blasphemous opinion, making the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie such a rule of faith, as hath beene said. Their iniuries and contumelies vnto Gods written Oracles (as hath heretofore been intimated) are especially two. First, they denie them to be any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire rule, for the number of precepts. Secondly, they make those verie precepts, which are acknowledged for diuine, insufficient for the establishment of true faith vnto themselues, without the Churches authoritie. We acknowledge them, euery way suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the edification of Christs Church in faith and maners: and consequently both to our positions, &amp; the truth, we teach, that all matters of faith, must be finally resolued into these diuine written verities, which for this reason we acknowledge the only infallible rule of faith: The meaning of which assertion is here to be further explicated, that so the truth may be maintained against their obiections.</p>

                        <head type="sub">In what sense we hold the Scriptures to be the rule of faith.</head>
                        <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we affirme, that the Scriptures are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible rule in matters of faith and Christian obedience, we vnderstand such a rule in those matters, as <hi>Aristotles Organon</hi> may be said of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick: supposing it were sound, &amp; free from all suspicion of error in euery point, and contained in it all the generall &amp; vndoubted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, from which all true forme of argumentation must be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and into which all must be finally resolued. To illustrate this truth, by a known practise. Our yonger students are bound to yeeld their absolute assent vnto <hi>Aristotles</hi> authoritie, in matters of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke: but not vnto any interpreter, that shall pretend it, saue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he shall make euident vnto them, that this was <hi>Aristotles</hi>
                           <pb n="306" facs="tcp:7863:179"/> meaning. And while they so onely, and no otherwise yeeld their assent, they yeeld it wholy and immediately vnto <hi>Aristotle,</hi> not to the interpreter, although by his meanes they came to know <hi>Aristotles</hi> meaning; which once knowne, without any further confirmation of other testimonie or authoritie, commands their obedience and assent. But ere they can fully assent vnto this great Master, or throughly perceiue his meaning, they must conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally assent vnto their priuate Tutors, or other expositors, and take his sense and meaning vpon their trust, and credite. In like manner (say we) in all matters, doctrines, or controuersies of faith, and Christian obedience, we are bound to yeeld our assent, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, absolutely, and finally vnto the authoritie of Scriptures onely: not vnto any Doctor, Expositor, or other whosoeuer he be, that shall pretend authoritie out of Scripture ouer our faith, saue onely when he shall make it cleare, and euident vnto vs, that his opinion is the true meaning of the Scripture. And thus yeelding our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute assent vnto the truth explained by him, wee yeeld it not to him, but vnto the Author of truth, whose words we hold to bee infallible in whose mouthes soeuer; and once knowne to be his words, they neede not the testimonie or authoritie of him, that did bring vs to the true knowledge of them. And before wee be brought to see their truth with our owne eyes, and feele it by our sense, (by the effects or experiments of it vpon our owne soules,) we are to limite our assent and obedience, (as it is set downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) according to the probabilities, or vnpartiall inducements, which we haue of the Expositors skill, and sinceritie, in dispensing diuine mysteries. And these motiues or inducements, which we haue of his skill and sinceritie, must be framed according to the rules or precepts of Scripture, not according to our affections, or humours: we may not thinke him most to be belieued, that is in highest place, or hath the greatest stroke in other affaires. For as the faith of Christ, so must our perswasion of the faithfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers, or skilfull seedes-men of faith, bee had without respect of persons.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 If we yeeld assent or obedience vnto any Expositor, or other, otherwise than vpon these conditions and limitations, then, as we said before, whilst wee yeelded absolute obedience vnto his doctrine that perswaded vs to true beliefe, because wee perceiued
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7863:179"/> that which he spake to be the word of God, we did not yeeld it vnto him, but vnto Gods word, deliuered and made knowne vnto vs by him: so heere againe by the same reason (onely inuerted) it will euidently follow, that if we beleeue any mans doctrines or decisions, to be the word of God, because he speakes it, or because we hold his words to be infallible, we doe not truly and properly beleeue the word of God, (suppose his doctrine were the word of God,) but his words and infallibilitie onely. Hence againe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that if we yeeld the same absolute and vndoubted assent vnto his authoritie, which we would doe vnto Gods word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately knowne in it selfe, and for it selfe; or relie vpon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie in expounding Gods word, as fully as he doth vpon the word, (which it is supposed he knowes immediately in it selfe, and for it selfe:) by doing thus we rob God of his honour, giuing that vnto man, which is only due to him. For the infallibility of this tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher hath the same proportion to all that thus absolutely beleeue him, as the infallibilitie of the Godhead hath vnto him; his words the same proportion, to all other mens faith, that Gods word hath vnto his. Gods word is the rule of his, and his words must bee the rule of all other mens faith. Or, to speake more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, God must bee a God onely to him, and he a God to all other men.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Heere it will be demaunded, how men, altogether illiterate, can examine any doctrine by Scriptures?<note n="a" place="margin">In what sense the Scriptures may be said the rule of mens faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> If they cannot read them, how shall they examine any thing by them? not examining the points of faith by them, how can they be said to be the rule of your faith? In such a sense as <hi>Aristotles</hi> workes (supposing them only authentick, &amp; all his opposites counterfaits or new-fangles) may be said to be the rule of blind-mens Logicke; for albeit they cannot read his works, yet are they capable of his generall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted rules, seeing they haue (as well as other men) a naturall facultie of discerning truth from falshood, and can distinguish betwixt rules deriued from the pure fountaine of truth in that kinde, and precepts drawne from coniecturall, erroneous, and corrupt surmises of shallow braines; if both be distinctly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnto them. And the rules of truth once fully apprehended and embraced, serue as a touchstone to discerne all consequences and conclusions, which shall be suggested vnto them by others:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7863:180"/> so as they wil admit of nothing for sound &amp; true Logick, but what may be resolued into the former, or some other principles, which they can perspicuously and immediately discerne, to haue beene drawne from the fountaine of truth, by the same naturall facultie or abilitie, by which they did discerne the former: for the facultie will still be like affected with all principles, of like nature, vse and perspicuitie. In like sort must the first and generall principles of faith be deriued from Scriptures, (the onely pure fountaine of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural truthes) vnto all illiterate hearts, by the ministerie of the learned. For hearts, though illiterate, once illuminated by Gods Spirit, are as apt to discerne spirituall principles, from falshood or carnal cōiectures, as the naturall man is to discerne natural truths, from errours of the same kinde. And these generall and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall principles of faith, engrafted in their hearts, serue as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rules, for discerning the consonancy or dissonancie of such particulars, as shall be suggested vnto them; as shall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) hereafter be declared: nor may they without iniurie to Gods Spirit or inward grace, admit any other precepts into the same ranke or societie with these, but eyther vpon euident and distinct deduction from them, or sure experiments of their like spirituall fruite and vse, for the amendment of life, and procuring that peace of conscience, which no naturall man can conceiue, much lesse can it be caused by meere naturall precepts. For wee suppose (what afterwards will manifest it selfe) that all truthes necessarie for men to beleeue, haue a distinct relish from all falshood, or other vnnecessarie or superfluous truthes: and may be knowne by their fruit, so men will be carefull to preserue the sinceritie of their spirituall taste.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Gods written word then, is the onely pure fountaine and rule of faith: yet not such immediately vnto all as it is written, but the learned,<note place="margin">Quâ scriptum.</note> or spirituall instructors, onely, whose hearts and consciences must be ruled by it, as in all other spirituall duties, so especially (as they are instructors) in this; That they may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any truthes, or principles of faith, vnto the illiterate, but such as are expresly contained in Gods written word, or (at least) are in substance the selfe same with these written truthes. If the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, through Gods iust iudgement, absolutely admit of other principles, and equalize them with these: such shall lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7863:180"/> errour, and peruert their faith. If they doubt of any mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether it be truly spirituall, or consonant to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, they may appeale to Scriptures, as they shall be expounded o them by others. Finally, they are tied to no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companie of men, whom they must vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion follow: but for their soules health, they may trie euery spirituall Physition. If they will be humorous, they may, but at their owne perill, both for temporall punishment in this life, and for eternall in the life to come.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 For conclusion; the Scripture according to our doctrine, and the generall consent of reformed Churches, is the onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of faith, in both respects or conditions of a perfect rule. First, in that it containes all the principles of faith, and pointes of saluation: So that no visible Church on earth may commend any doctrine to others, as a doctrine of faith, vnlesse it bee commended to them for such by the Scriptures, by which euerie ones doctrine, that acknowledgeth God for his Lord, must be examined, as by a law vncontrollable. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in that these principles of faith, are plainely, perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and distinctly, set downe to the capacities of all that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully follow their practicall rules most plaine, most perspicuous, and easie, to all capable of any rule or reason: So that this sacred Canon needs no associate, no addition of any authoritie as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible, nor more perspicuous than it selfe, to supply what it wants; onely the ministerie of men skilfull, and industrious in the search, or exposition of it, is to be supposed. And all these (be they neuer so excellent &amp; wel conuersant in them) are vnto Scriptures, but as the ordinary expositors of classique and authenticke bookes are vnto the chiefe Authors or Inuentors of the science contained in them: Supposing that the first authors were men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and infallible skill, and their expositors (as they vsually are) but of ordinarie capacitie, or experience in those faculties.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Finally,<note place="margin">The preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of faith,, aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rules, in respect of arts or sciences.</note> the bookes of Scriptures are to be reputed a more absolute rule for all matters of faith and diuine mysteries, than any bookes or writings of men are, for naturall sciences or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar professions, as in sundrie other respects, so in this, that they giue as more facile, so more infallible directions, for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out their true sense and meaning, than any other writings
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7863:181"/> doe, or writers could haue done, who, though present, could not be so fully assistant, but cannot so much as affoord their presence, to their expositours in the search of truthes, rather professed than fully conceiued, much lesse infallibly taught by them: whereas the Spirit of truth which first did dictate, is euery where present, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies assistant to such as seriously &amp; sincerely seeke the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in these diuine Oracles, conducting them from knowledge to knowledge, both by al such means as Artists haue for increasing their skill, and by other meanes extraordinarie, such as none in any other facultie can haue, nor any may hope for in the search of Scriptures, but onely such as delight in, and meditate vpon them day and night.</p>

This diuersitie of ages, and conditions of men in seuerall callings, who so well considers, may at the first sight easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our aduersaries willingnesse to wrangle in this point: whose vsuall practise, (as if they meant to cast a mist before the weake-sighted Readers eyes) is, to picke out heere and there some places

                        <p n="2">2 The Prophets of later ages did see Reuelations of matters, which had beene hid from the ancient Seers. And as it fared with them in the succession of visions, immediately inspired from God, not framed in imitation of any precedent written word, but to be then first written for posterities instruction: some saw one vision, some another, alwaies such were seene by the present Prophet,<note place="margin">All Scriptures not alike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to all ages.</note> as most concerned the present times. So fares it still with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Gods Church, and Christian people throughout all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, wherein visions haue sailed, and onely the written stories of former visions are reserued for perpetuall direction:
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7863:182"/> Some part of Gods will contained in Scripture is reuealed in one age, some in another; alwaies that which is most necessarie for the present time is most easie to be vnderstood by the faithfull then liuing, so they seeke the meaning of it as they should, not vpon cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie of knownig mysteries for the raritie of that skill, but for the edifying of Christs Church, which is sometimes out of reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in one point, sometimes in another: for which cause God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the knowledge of sundrie places to grow and increase, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the necessitie of the present times, nourishing (as it were) a continuall spring, for repairing or beautifying of his Temple.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 For this reason, those places which seeme most plaine and easie vnto vs, might bee more hard and difficult to such in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, as should haue sought their meaning too curiously; yea it might haue beene curiositie in that age, to haue sought halfe so much knowledge in them as wee now see at the first sight, because the time of their Reuelation, now is, was not then come.</p>

Many godly men, yea disciples in our Sauiours time, were ignorant of sundrie mysteries, which since his glorification haue beene communicated to the meanest of his flocke by the holy Spirit, who neuer failes to reueale Gods will, either by extraordinarie or ordinarie meanes, so men be not negligent to inquire after it by lawfull meanes. For God is as farre from partiall respect of ages as of persons; so the persons of seuerall ages respect his word alike,<note place="margin">All Scriptures not alike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not alike necessarie to all nations in the same age.</note> and as they should.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 The like obseruation wee may take, from the diuersitie of place or nations. As the knowledge of <hi>Ieremies</hi> Prophecies did more concerne the state <hi>of Iudah</hi> vnder <hi>Iehoiachim</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
                           <pb n="313" facs="tcp:7863:182"/> then the prophecie of <hi>Isaias,</hi> or some more ancient Prophet did: so in this our age, the knowledge of some one part of either their prophecies, and the manner of <hi>Iuda</hi> his progresse (in their times) to her <hi>ouerthrow,</hi> may more concerne this our land, than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of some other parts of the same or other Prophets. And yet those other whose knowledge concernes vs lesse, may at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant concerne some other land or people more. Alwaies, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious prouidence of our God directs the studie and industry of all that loue him to the search of those points, which most concerne thē; but suffers the endeuors of such, as by their transgressions haue procured his wrath, to run at randō, neuer seeking after those things which belong vnto their peace, vntil his iudgments ouertake them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 These Collections are no paradoxes, but truthes, probable enough of themselues to win the assent of sober and vnpartiall mindes, so capable of externall fortification, as they may easily be made euident and strong enough to conuince the froward mindes of such as delight most in contradiction. From their truth suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (which we are readie to make good against all gainsayers) it necessarily followes, that this question about the Scriptures ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie, or perspicuitie, cannot be vniuersally meant of all,<note place="margin">The question concerning the obscuritie or difficultie of Scriptures, cannot bee ment of all Scriptures, in respect of all ages, or all men.</note> and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of Scripture, in respect of all persons and ages: as whether no part be obscure or difficult to all, or any this day liuing. For, from this diuersitie of ages, we may easily discerne some things kept secret from the ancient Patriarches, by the wisedome of God made manifest vnto vs: and some things againe, by the disposition of the diuine prouidence, become obscure and difficult vnto vs, which were more manifest vnto them; as the particulars concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mysterie of mans redemption, were more obscure to them than vs; although the mysterie it selfe was, in some sort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, in the Propheticall and Mosaicall writings. So likewise all the Propheticall predictions or prelusions vnto the time of Grace, are better and more distinctly knowne of vs than them; because the expresse knowledge of these particulars more concernes vs that haue liued since, than those that liued before the fulnesse of time. So the Israelites Iudaical constitutions, their types and ceremonies, were much more plaine and easie vnto them, than vs: because the knowledge of these matters, if we speak of their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall law, more concerned theirs than any other state, as their
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7863:183"/> types and ceremonies, did their persons, vnto whom the Messias was to bee pourtraied or shadowed out, more than any in this present or other precedent age, since he was manifested in our flesh and substance. The knowledge of the moral law, the end and scope thereof (the obseruation of Gods commandements and doctrine of repentance after their transgression,) was equally perspicuous to both, because equally necessarie, most necessarie to both for their saluation.</p>

The same portion of Scripture may be difficult vnto some sort of men, and easie vnto others, without any preiudice to their sufficiencie, for being the perfect and infallible rule of faith to all. For, what we said before of diuers ages, we may conclude againe of diuers sorts or conditions of men. Sundrie places are more necessarie, and requisite to be vnderstood of this or that sort, and other places of others: nor are all places necessarie for the one to know, requisite for men of another condition or calling to search into. Thus the knowledge of many places is necessarie for him that is a publike Reader, Teacher, Instructer, or generall Ouerseer of Gods flocke: which to search into, or laboriously to examine, would be curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie in him that had no such calling, especially if engaged to any other, which might iustly challenge the greatest portion in his best endeauours, or take vp the most part of his choicer houres for studie.</p>

Should one of their greatest Philosophers, that were no Cleargie-man, or profest Diuine, professe he knew the meaning of that

                        <p n="9">9 That the Scriptures therefore may be said a sufficient rule of faith and Christian carriage, to all sorts or conditions of men, it is sufficient that euery Christian man of what sort or condition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, may haue the general and necessary points of Catholike faith, and such particulars as belong vnto a Christian and religious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in his owne vocation, perspicuously and plainely set down in them. And no doubt but it was Gods will, to haue them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning one calling not so facile vnto such as were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profession: that euery man might hence learne sobrietie, and be occasioned to seeke, if not only yet principally, after the true sense and meaning of those Scriptures, which either necessarily concerne all, or must direct him in that Christian course of life whereunto his God hath called him. But shall this difficultie of some parts (which ariseth from the diuersitie of vocations) be thought any hindrance, why the whole Canon of Scriptures should not be a perfect rule to all in their seuerall vocations? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some vniuersall Artist, or complete Cyclopedian, should set out an absolute systeme, or rule for all secular sciences: it would be a ridiculous exception to say, his works could be no perfect rule for yong Grammarians, Rhetoriciās, Logicians, or Moralists, because he had some difficult Mathematicall questions, or abstruse Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical discourses, which would require a grounded scholers seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paines, &amp; long search, to vnderstand them throughly: and if he should admonish yong students, to begin first with those common and easie arts, &amp; not to meddle with the other, vntil they had made good triall of their wit and industrie in the former: this would be a good token of a perfect teacher, and one fit to rule our course in all those studies which he professeth. And yet the Scriptures (which the Iesuits would not haue acknowledged for the rule of Christian life) besides all the infallible rules of life, and saluation (common to all) admonish euery man to seek after the knowledge of such things as are most for edifying, or most befitting his particular calling.</p>

So plaine and easie they are vnto all ages, and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, especially to men of meaner place, that I much doubt whether the Pope himselfe, and all his Cardinals, were able in this present age to speake so plainly vnto the capacitie, or so familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the experience of men of their qualitie vnto whom he wrote. For, setting aside the absolute truth &amp; infallibility of his <hi>doctrines;</hi> his manner of deliuering them is so familiar, so lowly, so heartily humble, so naturall and so well befitting such mens disposition in their sober thoughts, as were impossible for the Pope to attaine vnto or imitate, vnlesse he would abiure his triple Crowne, and abstract himselfe from all Court-state or solace, vnlesse he would, for seuen yeares, addict himselfe vnto familiaritie, with such men in a pastorall charge. It was an excellent admonition of one of their Cardinals (if I mistake not, and would to God our Church would herein be admonished by him,) to begin alwaies with the latter end of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. For once well experienced in them, we should easily attaine vnto the true sense and meaning of the former parts, which vsually are doctrinall, and therefore more difficult than the latter. Yet the true reason of those difficulties in the former parts containing doctrine, is, because he wrote them against the disputers of that age, especially the Iewes. Euen in this age they are onely seene in matters concerning the learned expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors of Scriptures, not necessarie for priuate and vnlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to know. And the especiall reason, why his doctrine in some Epistles (as in the Epistle to the Romanes) seemes obscure, difficult, and intricate, is, because learned men of later times haue too much followed the authorities of men in former ages, who had examined. Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, according to the rule or phrase of those arts or faculties, with which they were best acquainted, or else had measured his controuersie with the Iewes, by the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or contentions of the age wherein they liued. Where this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:7863:184"/> partialitie vnto some famous mens authoritie (which indeed is made a chiefe rule in expounding Scriptures, euen by many such, as in words, are most earnest to haue Scriptures the onely rule of faith) once laid aside, and the rules of faith, elsewhere most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously and plainly set downe by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> vnpartially scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: his doctrine in that Epistle would become so perspicuous and easie vnto the learned, as it might by them bee made plaine enough and vnoffensiue to the vnlearned. For the light of truth, elsewhere deliuered by this lampe of the Gentiles (might it be admitted as a rule, against some expositions of that Epistle) would direct mens steps to auoid those stumbling blocks, which many haue fallen vpon. But to conclude this assertion; their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie (take them as they are) is no iust exception against this part of Scripture: because it remaines difficult still, euen for this reason, that it is held generally for difficult, and is not made a rule, indeed for our directions; but other mens opinions or coniectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it are taken for an authenticke Rubricke, by whose leuell only we must aime at our Apostles meaning from which we may not, without imputations of irregularitie, swerue in the decision of pointes (to say no worse) as now they are made hard and knottie.</p>

For as mens callings are diuers, and Gods gifts to men in their diuers callings in nature and qualitie different: so likewise is the measure of his like gifts, to men in the same calling not one and the same. To some he giues more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to others lesse: yet all he commands, not to presume aboue that which is written, &amp; euery man to limit his desires of knowing that which is written, by the distinct measure of Gods giftes in himselfe, not to affect or presume of such skill as they haue vnto whom God hath giuen a greater talent. And besides this, that the Scripture is the inexhaustible storehouse, whence all men haue their seuerall measures of diuine knowledge, as well he that

For this were pride and arrogancie (the fatall enemies of all true Christian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) if so his gifts be lesse than others.

                        <p n="2">2 Lastly, euen in respect of places (though containing points of saluation) onely thus imperfectly knowne (though as perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and cleare as can be required the rule of faith should be) the question is not, whether they be very obscure, and difficult vnto some, or vnto the maior part of mankinde: if we consider them as they are, or may be, not as they should or might be, that is, if wee consider them as disobedient to the truth knowne, or carelesse to amend their liues by this light of Scripture. For vnto all such as hate it, this very light it selfe proues an occasion of falling. Nor
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7863:186"/> could any thing be more plainly or perspicuously set downe in any other rule of faith imaginable, than this very point we now handle, is in Scriptures, to wit, that such parts of them, as containe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters necessarie to saluation, are most easie to some, most hard to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And albeit they might, through the iniquitie of mankinde, proue difficult to all, or impossible to be vnderstood of most now liuing (liuing as for the most part we do) yet were this difficulty or impossibilitie of vnderstanding them aright (vpon these suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) no hindrance to all, why they should not be a complet rule of faith at all, no iust reason for admitting any infallible authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides theirs.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <note place="margin">This is a point to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, because the weaknesse and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies of all our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries arguments will best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if they be hereto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as shall appeare by the particulars in this, and the next section.</note>3 For of such as admit any authority equiualent to theirs, it must be further demanded; whether the infallibilitie of it, can take away that blindnesse of heart, which by Gods iust iudgement, lights v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all such as detaine the knowledge of God or his sacred word in vnrighteousnesse? If, for their sinnes, God punish them with this spirituall darknesse, in discerning his will reuealed in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word: no other infallible authoritie (as we suppose) can take away those scales from their eyes, which hinder their sight in the meanes of their saluation. If men haue beene called to this light, and preferre darknesse before it: either they must receiue sight and direction from it againe, or continue still in ignorance and the shadow of death; but doth God locke vp all or most mens eyes in such darknesse? No, for this blindnes (by our doctrine) befals only such, as haue deserued it by the fore-mentioned sinnes, which once remoued by repentance, the rule of life shal inlighten thē; vnrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; no other rule or authority shall teach them the way to life.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Since we thus grant, that the Scriptures may be obscure to most men by their owne default, but perspicuous to others free from like fault or demerit: it remaines, we further inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same Scriptures do not most plainly set downe: First, the causes why they are so obscure to some, and perspicuous to others: Secondly, the remedie or meanes how their obscuritie or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may be preuented. If they plainly teach these two points, this is a sure argument that they are, if not, that they cannot be, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a rule of faith as wee acknowledge them. For this very point, [That the Scriptures in respect of diuers persons are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and perspicuous, though obscure to none but through their
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7863:186"/> owne default] is a principle of Christian faith, and therefore must be plainly set downe in the absolute complete rule of faith. And (to omit others in their due place to bee inserted) what can be more perspicuously taught, either by Scriptures or other writings than this truth, <hi>God giueth grace to the humble, and resisteth the proud?</hi> or this, <hi>He will confound the wisedome of the wise, or such as glorie in their wisedome?</hi> These and like rules of Gods iustice in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proud and disobedient, hold as true in the search of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in any other matter, yea especially herein. Thus were the Scribes and Pharisees (men of extraordinarie skill in Scriptures) blinded in the most necessarie pointes of their saluation, though most plainly set downe in Scriptures. For what could be more plainly set downe then many testimonies of their <hi>Messias?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of farre greater difficultie they could with dexteritie vnfold: how chanced it then they are so blinded in the other? <hi>They were scattered in the proud imagination of their hearts,</hi> and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conceits of their prerogatiues in being <hi>Moses</hi> successours: and in their stead, simple and illiterate, but humble and meeke spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men, raised vp, to be infallible teachers of the Gentiles, to vnfold those mysteries of mans redemption, (which the Scribes and Pharisees could not see) with euidence of truth to inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the silly and ignorant, and conuince the consciences of their learned proud oppugners. By their ministerie, Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and Mosaicall mysteries became a light vnto the Gentile, whose life had beene in the shadow of death: whilest a veile was laid before the hearts of the most learned Iewes, so that euen whilst the Sunne of righteousnesse, which inlightens euery man that comes into the world, did arise in their coast, and ascend vnto their Zenith, they groape their way, as men that walke in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pathes by darke night.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Was the Scripture therefore no rule of faith vnto these Iewes, to whom it was so difficult and obscure? Or is it not most euident, that this blindnesse did therefore come vpon <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they hated this light, carried away with lowd cries of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum Domini, Templum Domini,</hi> as the Papists now are with <hi>The Church, The Church:</hi> And for words of supposed disgrace offered to it (only vpon a surmise that Christ had said hee would destroy and build it vp again) brought to seek the destruction of the glory of it,

Why could they not? Because they had, as the Papists now haue (though not so openly) disclaimed the Scriptures for the rule of their faith, &amp; did follow the precepts or traditions of men; and God (as we said before) hath so decreed that such as neglect the truth knowne, or loue darknesse more than light, should bee giuen ouer to this reprobate sense; that the more euident the truth is, the more hatefull it should be to them: as the hate of these Scribes &amp; Pharises to our Sauiour was greater then their fore-elders had beene to the Prophets, because the light of his doctrine was greater, his reprehensions more sharpe, and their deeds and hypocrisie worse than their Fathers. No maruaile then, if it be so hard a matter to recouer a learned Papist, or make a Iesuite recant his error in this point, seeing they are farther gone in this Iewish disease of contemning Gods word, following tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and precepts of men, for the rule of their faith, than these Iewes themselues were; not likely therefore they would haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our Sauiour himselfe, if they had liued in his time. Nor should the ingenious Reader thinke we hyperbolize or ouer-lash, when we charge them with deeper blasphemie in this point, than these Iewes were guiltie of: as if this were strange, seeing they are such great schollers, and professe that they loue Christ as well as we: for so would these Iewes boast of their antiquitie, and skill in Scriptures, and thought that they loued God, and his seruant <hi>Moses,</hi> as well as Christ and his Apostles did. But it was Gods purpose to confound the wisedome of the worldly-wise: of the Scribes &amp; Pharisees then, and of the learned Priests &amp; Iesuits now.</p>

For can any man thinke, hee see where these fierce blowes would light? As much as wee haue said, is most cleere out of this verie place of <hi>Austen,</hi> which hee would throw vpon vs. Most cleere it is that vnto such as follow our Sauiours methode, set downe before, that is, vnto such as will become like little children, and beginne (as it were) a new againe; the Scripture (which for the present seemes hard to all farre entered into the worlds schoole) is perspicuous, cleere, and easie to bee learned. But whether it bee hard to become such a one, or whether it be a difficult matter to lay aside all pride, and selfe-conceit, is no part of the point now in question, nothing at all to this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purpose. To man, no doubt, it is most hard, or rather altogether impossible. But what it is to man once made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the grace of God, and power of his Spirit, let Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the fountaine of grace be Iudge.

Our Sauiours next wordes imply the contrarie: but of this question wee shall take occasion hereafter. Onely now I say the Iesuites of all other are most vncapable of this plea. For they hold free will in men, wherby they may assent vnto grace offered: and if men haue free will, and Christ offer his grace vnto such, as vse it well, the learning of humilitie, and taking vp his yoake will be easie through grace, though impossible to nature. But let this question concerning grace and free will, stand still, as it doth, in controuersie, betwixt vs and them, and the Lutheranes. This is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7863:194"/> granted by all; that if Christ grant his grace to all that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to follow his precepts, then is it easie to all, to learne this first lesson of Christianitie, <hi>lowlinesse, and meekenesse,</hi> the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of true knowledge in Scripture, without which all other learning in them is but verball. As this is confessed by all, so would I be resolued by any Iesuite, whether, if it be Christs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suse to denie his grace to any, it be not altogether impossible for him to learne this lesson perfectly, or to become a good proficient in the schoole of Christ, although the Pope, their supposed infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible teacher, should vouchsafe to catechise him <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> What hath this Iesuite got then, by his fierce obiecting this difficultie of learning humilitie, for to make the Scriptures seeme obscure? If the same obscuritie, the same impossibilitie of vnderstanding them aright, still remaine, albeit the Pope himself, should stretch his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie power, to illustrate them with his infallible authoritie.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 Or wil it not be more hard for the Pope (being so highly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in secular honor and dignitie as he is) to stoop so low as a little child for lowlinesse of mind, than it will be for vs poore and sillie men. If it be more hard for him, than vs so to do, wee are more likely to become better schollers in Christs schoole, than his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Holines: more likely to be more certaine of the true sense or meaning of Scriptures then he can be, much more certaine (in all necessarie points) hereof, than he can be of his infallibilitie. For this lesson of true humilitie must of necessitie be learned, ere we can proceed in the true knowledge of these mysteries. Suppose this be a verie hard lesson to learne, yet <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> it will be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as mens places are higher, or their dignities greater: hardest of all to men of highest place and greatest dignities, specially if their aduancements, to such preeminencies be (as many Popes and Cardinals haue beene) <hi>per saltum,</hi> or <hi>ab extremo in extremum sine medio,</hi> like lazie beggers sodainly mounted on stately steedes: shall then this dfficultie late obiected depriue these Scriptures of this dignitie, which wee pleade for? Shall this debarre them from being the infallible rule of faith? or rather doe they not, in giuing this verie rule of learning humilitie, and thus forewarning of their impossibility to be vnderstood without it, approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be an excellent rule of faith; a more excellent rule for these super-excellent diuine mysteries, than any other rules
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7863:195"/> are for ordinarie, pettie, or triuiall arts? For suppose <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other more exquisite, though he an excellent teacher of the Hebrew tongue, should in his Grammer <hi>haue giuen</hi> this caueat (easie to be confirmed by sound reason and experience) that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer would become perfect in that language, should begin his studie in his younger daies, before he were engaged to subtile or profounder studies, or giuen to deepe meditations of realities, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would be verie hard for him, to descend againe vnto Grammer rules, and beginne like a schoole-boy to cunne declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, coniugations, without which, and many other pettie rules about altering of vowels, he could neuer hope to be an absolute Hebrician: Had <hi>Bellarmine</hi> set downe these or like caueats more at large, should this admonition be accounted any iust exception, why his Grammer (otherwise supposed authenticke,) should not be a perfect rule for learning Hebrew? or must we for this reason haue stretched our wits to inuent some infallible teacher of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew for such men? I am sure he that should haue found the truth of his admonitions by experience in himselfe, or obseruation in others, would commend his iudgement herein, and thinke so much better of his Grammer, or wish that he himselfe had known, or others would obserue these admonitions, whiles they were young, and rather vse <hi>Bellarmine</hi> than experience, for their Schoolemaster in this point.</p>
                        <p n="14">14 Doubtlesse it is for want of acquainting youth, and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with the former rules of Scripture, which make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generally either seeme obscure or difficult, or causeth men mistake thm seeming euident. For when they are growne to mans estate, or be embarked in worldly affaires, or inuested in secular dignities, before they haue studied Scriptures, or practised the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer precepts: this seeming difficultie, either moueth them to seek for other rules, more easie to their capacitie, or not to care for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rule of faith at all, or else to transforme this which God hath giuen for reforming his image in them, into the nature of their corrupt affections. Were this lesson of becomming like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, throughly planted in our hearts, when we were children: true knowledge in other parts of Scriptures would grow with vs, and faith (once planted in humilitie, while our hearts were tender, and easie to be wrought vpon by this plaine and easie precept) albeit at

For otherwise the Scriptures were written to enlightē vs, not themselues, or such as wrote them. And vnto such, as are blinded in their owne desires, difficult they are and obscure, without any respect of persons: to the Pope, as well as to any meaner man, not more proud, or carnall than He.

He liued at Ingolstade, and the light of Gods word was at Rome lockt vp within the compasse of the Consistorie, for that he could not see to make his comparison of it.

For in this countrey wherein we liue, we see the Candlesticke by vertue of the light, not the light by meanes or vertue of the Candlesticke. And yet if your Church be the Candlesticke, as you suppose, and the Scripture the light (as you expresly acknowledge:) we must by your doctrine discerne the light of Scriptures, onely by the commendation, explication, or illumination of your Church, the Candlesticke. And this illumination is onely her bare asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Scriptures she seldome expounds, but onely by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues or Anathemees. The best correction that can be made of this vntoward, crooked, vnwieldy similitude, would be this: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Doctor supposeth the Pope to be the Church, and saith further, <hi>necesse est vt lumen illud fidei quod in diuinis literis splendet praeferat Ecclesia:</hi> Let him put <hi>lucem</hi> for <hi>lumen,</hi> and so the Pope
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7863:202"/> (being by his assertion the Church) may be truly called <hi>Lucifer.</hi> And then, as, when cloth shrinkes in the wetting, men shape their garments accordingly, making sometimes a Ierkin of that which was intended for a Iacket: so out of this vnhandsome ill-spunne similitude, which was marred in the making, we may frame a shorter, which will hold exceeding well, on this fashion: Euen as Sathan, being the Prince of darknesse, doth to mens see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming transforme himselfe into an Angell of light: Iust so doth the Roman <hi>Lucifer,</hi> being (by <hi>Valentians</hi> confession) but the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke, labour to transforme himselfe into the light it selfe; and would be taken for such a light or Candle, as should make the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of heauen it selfe (Gods word) to shine most splendently and clearly by the glorious beames of his maiesticall infallibilitie once cast vpon it. For otherwise, vnlesse the supernaturall glory of his infallibilitie do infuse light, or adde fresh lustre to this light, or lanterne of truth, the Candlesticke naturally giues no increase of perspicuitie to the light or candle, Which wil shine as cleare in a priuate mans hands, (so he wil take the paines to hold it,) as in a publike Candlesticke.

But hee meant of a perfect and true knowledge, not such as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (when hee gaue this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere) dreamed of; <hi>vt neque sit puer, neque anus Christiana, quae non sciat Christum natum, &amp; incarnatum fuisse.</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was sufficiently knowne (in this mans sense of his wordes) because there is <hi>neyther Christian childe, nor old wife, but knowes that Christ was incarnate and borne.</hi> Too many I feare of his, and his fellowes catechizing, know Christ no otherwise, then olde wiues, or little children know ordinarie matters or stories past, that is, onely by olde wiues tales, lying Legends, or tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And on this fashion, and better, did the Iewes know <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and beleeued on him; yet did they neyther know him, nor his doctrine, as they should haue done, nor in such a sense, as the Scripture vseth this word Knowledge. Such as hee would haue vs content our selues withall is rather blindnesse then knowledge, and makes a man neuer a whit the better Christian, but a grea er hypocrite.</p>

The Heretiques of olde time (say they) haue vrged Scriptures for their doctrine vehemently and copiously: we will giue them better hold, and helpe them to presse this point a little harder; They did vrge Scriptures most cunningly, most subtily, and hereby deceiued many, yea almost staggered the very elect.

Their wicked cunning serued as a foyle so to set forth his heauenly skill, as the Enchaunters themselues could not but see the finger of God in his working: herein more ingenuous then the moderne Iesuites; who in so cleare a point as this, we now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, after so many foyles as they haue taken, will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the force of that Scripture in themselues; <hi>Magna est veritas &amp; praeualet.</hi> The reason is; because they will not come

But with what weapon did our Sauiour vanquish Sathan, that had set vpon him with Scripture? did hee charge him <hi>sub poena anathematis</hi> to bee silent? or did hee craue the Churches peace vnder paine of greater penalties? or did he appeale vnto the infallible authoritie, or Supreame Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Iewish Church? did hee except against him for vsing an vnlawful, Heretical weapon? can you deny that he foyled him with these very weapons, wherewith wee now contend, that all Heretikes (Sathans followers) are to bee assaulted and repulsed, ere they can be lawfully foyled and quite ouerthrowne? And here I would beseech all sober-minded Christians, euen as they loue our Sauiour Christ, (the chiefe C ptaine of the Lords Host, the authour and finisher of our faith) and as they hate Sathan himselfe (the head and Prince of all Gods, Christs, and our enemies) to consider these subsequent reasons well, and waigh this instance in the quiet, calme, and setled motions of their hearts.</p>

Sathans strength since that time hath beene lesse, and Christs power greater; so that in his strength wee may be stronger then all Sathans followers. Thirdly wee know that the Scripture is in it selfe much more fauourable vnto truth, then vnto falshood; and <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> farre more apt to confirme true Religion, and instruct in points of faith, then to establish he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, or fill the world with errours? onely the sonnes of darknes haue beene wiser in their generation, then such as should bee, or (in some measure) are the sonnes of light. And if Heretiques may seeme to haue had the better sometimes of the Orthodoxe, in trying controuersies by Scripture; this doubtlesse was for no other reason but only this: Their alacritie and industrie in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scriptures for maintenance of errours, was greater then the others for establishment and confirmation of the truth; otherwise, as wee said before, the truth is more consonant to the puritie and integritie of Sacred Writ, then any falshood (though neuer so faire in shew) can be: And Christ Iesus is more powerful, &amp; more skilfull, more able &amp; more willing to assist and strengthen such as follow him,<note place="margin">

The Pope was much to blame, to let <hi>Athanasius</hi> suffer such paines, exile and abuse by the <hi>Arian</hi> faction, in the defence of the truth, if his infallibilitie could haue composed the quarrell. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> hath beene famous throughout all Generations since, for his learned labours against the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie; <hi>Cyril</hi> for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate confutation of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and yet the Scripture was the best weapon they knew. Neither of them did euer appeale to the Popes infallibilitie, nor the Popes themselues which then liued would haue vsed any other rule but Scripture, for their own defence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Your vsuall argument is, that vnlesse God had left such an infallible authoritie as might take vp all controuersies; hee had not sufficiently prouided for his Church. Then, by your consent, he left such an authoritie, as was sufficient to performe this good seruice to it. To whome then did hee commit it? To the Sea of Rome say you. How chanceth it your fore elders did not put it in practise, and make the power of it better knowne? This blame you cannot lay vpon the Almightie; for hee, for his part, (by your confession) prouided abundantly for the peace and quiet of his Church. And yet it seemes the Church was ill prouided for, when Schismes and Heresies sprung so fast. This therefore was your Churches fault, that bore this spirituall sword in vaine, and would not vse it; when the Christian world stood most in neede of it, for the finall decision of controuersies. So then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee should grant you, that your Church had sometimes the birthright, amongst all the Israel of God: yet might we iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say of it, as olde <hi>Israel</hi> said of <hi>Reuben</hi> his eldest sonne, Thy dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is gone; and we were to seeke this Supreame authoritie, (if God had giuen any such Supremacie to any) in some other tribe which were likely to vse it better.</p>

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:7863:215"/> that flourishing age of learned and religious Fathers; and since it hath beene so well knowne and acknowledged, Heresies haue beene more thinne sowne, then before; (few or none till <hi>Luther</hi> arose daring to confront the Church or Popes authoritie, with Scripture:) You giue vs hereby iust cause to suspect, that Heresie had got the vpper hand of truth, for the multitude of followers; that there had beene a generall combination in falshood till <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> brake it. For if sundrie of the Auncient Heretiques, with whose doctrine the Primitiue Church was pestered, could vnder pretence of Scripture, haue got into Supreame authority; or haue established their propositions, framed (as they thought out of Gods word) with strength of temporall sword, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> did his: It were great simplicitie to thinke, that they could not haue beene content, to haue let the Scriptures sleepe, or haue threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all with death and destruction, that should haue vrged them to the preiudice of their opinions, especially of such opinions as did concerne their dignitie. For all falshood and spirituall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hates this light, and could either wish it put out, or them vtterly extinct that obiect it to them. As hee that hath wound himselfe into an others inheritance by some quirke in Law or Captious clause not well vnderstood, would not bee much offended to haue all euidences or primarie coppies either burnt or buried, euen that by which hee got it, if it, vpon better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or more indifferent hearing, were likely to ouerthrow his title.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And if wee may ghesse at the course of Sathans policie, in watching his opportunities to effect his purpose by the customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fashion of secular Politicians (his Schollers) in like cases; most probable it is, that after these broiles of dissention about the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of peace so frequent in the Primitiue Church, the great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and bodily affliction which followed thereon; most men grew weary of their spirituall warfare, and became slouthfull in the search of Scriptures, the only Armorie for all munition, in this kind of warre.

Your Church had the whole multitude of Nations as readie at her becke to applaude your cruell designes against them, as the High-Priestes and Elders had the Iewish people to approue our Sauiours condemnation. The manner of their tortures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with such certaintie of ignominie and disgrace, were dreadfull to the setled and deliberate cogitations of flesh and bloud; their memorie (for ought they could in humane probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie foresee) was either to sleepe with their bodies, and lie buried in their ashes, or (if suruiuing them) to be perpetually scourged by the scurrilous pens and tongues of their bitter aduersaries.

By your Churches continuall practise I should gesse this would bee your replie, (for there is no other left,) that the Pope can constraine men to subscribe to his decrees, by fire and sword.

                        <p n="8">8 It is vsuall with your writers to argue thus, <hi>We cannot know Scriptures to be</hi> the Scriptures, <hi>but by the authoritie of the Church; therefore we cannot know the true sense and meaning of them, but by the infallible authoritie of the same.</hi> The antecedent of which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we haue partly shewed, and hereafter (God willing) shall shew to be most false: so for the argument it selfe I only now say, that it may be farre more probably inuerted vpon you, thus. The Iewes may come to acknowledg the new Testament for the verie Gospell of their Messias, and to beleeue in heart, and professe with their mouthes the mysteries therein contained, by sober and diligent comparing them with the prophecies of the old, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the infallible authoritie of your Church: therefore they may know the true sense and meaning of the Gospell, in all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7863:221"/> to saluation, without any such infallible authoritie. For it is a matter of farre lesse difficultie, for any man of sense and reason, to deduce particular conclusions from generall and euident principles, then to finde out the generall and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall principles, by naturall notions, or other principles: And therefore more easie for any such man to resolue his conscience in particular pointes of faith or Christian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after hee hath found out the foundation of Christian faith, (to wit <hi>Christ Iesus crucified, raised from the dead,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generall dictates of faith in the Apostolicall writings) then to come vnto the acknowledgement, and beleefe of these funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points themselues, from the broken knowledge (such as the Iewes haue) of the old Testament. And thus it euidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that if the old Testament be a rule vnto the Iewes, for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the truth of the new, much more may the new, once acknowledged by them, and admitted of equal authoritie with the old, be a perfect rule for them in matters of saluation. And if these Scriptures are, or may be a rule to the Iewes, (if they will beleeue them) then must they be a rule to al Christians that beleeue them. No Christian I hope will denie, but that the old Testament is the rule of the Iewes: For the vnbeleeuing Iewes shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in what part of the world soeuer, for not following this rule, which God hath commended and made knowne vnto them, not for not acknowledging the Popes infallibility, of which many of them neuer heard. And if the old Testament be such to them, much more must the whole Canon bee vnto vs such a rule: and if we die in misbeliefe or infidelitie, we shall be iudged by this rule of Gods Law and Gospell, which we transgressed, not by the Popes decrees or expositions of it. That many Christians by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession erre in points of faith, or mistake the true sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, or peruert it to their destruction, proceeds from their ingratitude towards God that gaue it, and for their delight in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood.

If they replie, the Iewes might beleeue all points of Roman-Catholike faith aright, so they would admit their Church as Iudge or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of faith: the Iewes might with as good reason reioyne: so might the Romanes beleeue all points of Iudaisme, would they acknowledge this supposed infallibility of doctrine to be in their Rabbinicall expositions, not in the Popes determinations. But the Romist, I suppose, would desire a signe ere hee beleeued them here: and are wee lesse bound by the rule of faith, to desire some tollerable satisfaction to these reasons following, ere we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them in this point, as preiudiciall in our iudgement to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in generall, as subscription to Rabbinicall doctrine is vnto Christian veritie.</p>

                        <p n="12">12 First, if it would remoue that temper which makes the Iew a more vnprofitable hearer of Scripture, then young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants are of stoicall morall discpline, your Church is guiltie of wilfull malice and murther of soules that will not apply this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible key, able of it selfe to open that veile of adamant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Iewes hearts are so masked, that neither the light of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall, Propheticall, Apostolicall, or Euangelicall writings can finde entrance vnto them. Secondly, albeit this supposed infallible authoritie could remoue the former veile, yet were it not in this respect to be acknowledged an infallible rule of faith, but rather an ordinarie and necessarie meanes, (such as we acknowledge the lawfull magistracie or ministerie to bee) for squaring or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning mens fraile or exorbitant affections, the better to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell with Gods word, the most exact, inerrable, and all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule of faith, euen by your consent: were it not for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie or vitious disposition of mans nature, which (as you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise acknowledge) is the sole cause why the Scriptures are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and minister matter of contention.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 But our aduersaries attribute not any such vertue to their infallible rule, as to make a foole wise, the lasciuious chast, the drunkard sober, a knaue honest, the impudent modest, or ambitious lowly: for euen the Pope himselfe, in whose bosome
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7863:223"/> this rule lodgeth, may harbour these and like vices in his brest: he may (by his owne followers confession) be as incorrigible for bad life and manners, as infallible for matters of doctrine. Seeing then their supposed rule cannot remoue those impediments which detaine the Iewes with other infidels and heretikes from the truth: can it make men beleeue aright whilest they remaine? If it can: it is of greater force than eyther our Sauiours authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or skill in Scriptures. Neyther of which, not all his trauels and best indeuours heere on earth, though infinitely surpassing any paines the Pope is willing to take, could instruct the Iewes in the doctrine of faith, whilest their carnall affections remained in strength. <hi>How can ye beleeue,</hi> (saith he, who spake as neuer man spake,<note place="margin">

                        <p n="14">14 To conclude then, If the infidelitie of the Iewes be any iust exception, why Scriptures cannot be the perfect rule of faith: this exception will disinable the Romane Churches infallible authoritie, for being such a rule. But if the generall error of the Iewes, in the very maine foundation of religion, be no iust excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why eyther the Scripture according to vs, or the Churches authoritie according to them, should not bee the rule of faith: then cannot the errors of heretikes, or varietie of opinions about the sense and meaning of particular places of lesse moment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the sufficiency of Scripture, for performing all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by eyther partie in their supposed absolute rule. For it shall, God willing, be made euident in due place, that the selfe-same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections (only different in degree, sometimes not so much) which caused the Iewes infidelity in our Sauiours time, are the onely rootes and fountaines of heresies and dissentions throughout all ages.</p>
                        <p n="15">15 And as elsewhere is already proued, wheresoeuer the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall affection for degree and qualitie is, the heresie or infidelitie is likewise the same, euen in such as hold contrarie opinions, and would perhaps maintain their cōtrariety vnto death: for, as many, strongly perswaded of their beleefe in Christ, shall goe for infidels in that last day: so may such, as thinke themselues Orthodoxes, be tainted with the contrarie heresie which they impugne, if sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7863:223"/> to the same affections which did breed it. But for vs to account such as make profession of Christianitie, infidels, or such as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to Orthodoxall doctrine, heretikes, would bee iniurious and vnlawfull: not because the former assertion indefinitely taken is not warrantable; but because no man can precisely discerne the identitie of inward affection, saue he alone that knoweth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of all hearts. Thus all the blasts of vaine doctrine they can oppose vnto the truth we maintaine, doe in the issue fasten the rootes of faith once rightly planted, howsoeuer they may shake the timorous or faint-hearted Christian, or cause the weake in faith, not cleauing to Scripture as their onely infallible rule, and sure supporter, dangerously to reele and stagger. But though they fall, yet Gods word shal neuer faile to approue it selfe a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule, besides others in these two respects: first, in that none can faile in that course which it prescribes, or fall away from faith but by such meanes as the Iew hath done, the true causes of whose A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie, and incredulitie it hath expresly foretold, and fully regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to posteritie: Secondly, because such as it doth not, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule, meanes, or authoritie possible eyther in the earth, or in the region below the earth, shall euer winne to true Christian faith.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 Our Sauiour in the fore-cited controuersies saw well how earnestly the Iewes were set to peruert Scriptures for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, how glad to finde any pretence out of them eyther to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their dislike of his doctrine, or wreake their malice vpon his person. Reason he had as great to distaste their practise herein as the Pope himself can haue to inueigh against heretiks for the like. Neither is there any person now liuing, against whom any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of harme can be more heinous then the intention of murther against him, nor any sort of men (vnlesse the Iesuites, Spanish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, or such as they suborne) so cruelly bent as these Iewes were, to seeke bloud vnder a shew of loue to pure immaculate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Yet doth not our Sauior accuse the Scriptures (though ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of so grieuous &amp; dangerous misconstruction) of obscurity or difficultie, or of being any way the occasion of Iewish heresie, or his persecution thence caused: nor doth he disswade those very men, which had thence sucked this poisonous doctrine, much lesse others, frō reading, but exhorts them in truth &amp; deed, not in word &amp; fancie only, to relie on Scriptures as the rule of saluation. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in thē ye think, &amp; (that rightly) to haue eternall life.</hi> Not intimating the least necessitie of any external authority infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to direct them, he plainly teacheth it was the infernal distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their proud affections, which had disproportioned their minds to this straight rule, and disinabled them for attaining true beliefe, which neuer can be rightly raised but by this square &amp; line.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 It was not then the reading of Scriptures which caused them mistake their meaning and persecute Him, but the not reading of them as they should. Erre they did, not knowing the Scriptures
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7863:225"/> and know them they did not, because they did not read them throughly, sincerely, searching out their inward meaning. And thus to read them a fresh, as our Sauiour prescribed them, (lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside ambitious desires) was the only remedie for to cure that distemper which they had incurred by reading them amisse. It were a mad kinde of counsell (better befitting a witch or cunning woman, then a wise man) to disswade one frō vsing medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him by men of skill, because he had incurred some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous disease, by taking the like out of his own humour, or in a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either without or contrary to the prescript of professed Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiōs: yet such and no better our aduersaries aduise heretofore hath beene: and the strength of all their arguments in the point now in hand to this day cotinues this: We must not make Scriptures the rule of faith, because many heresies haue sprung thence, and great dissensions growne in the Church, whiles one followes one sense, and another the contrarie.

Or if this they call in question, let them resolue vs why Idolatrie in those ages, wherein true Prophets flourished most, should bee as frequent and various, as heresies in latter times, wherein the preaching of the Gospell is most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The true reason whereof as we suppose is this: These lying Spirits were alike apt to imitate Gods seuerall manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (whether by meanes ordinary or extraodinary) in diuerse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. At all times, if we compare either their natiue capacitie or acquired skill with our owne, though in matters wherein we haue beene most conuersant: if to their sagacitie wee adde their mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious temper and eager desires of doing ill, which alwayes adde
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:7863:229"/> an edge to wit in mischeuous inuention: In all these they so farre exceed the sonnes of seduced <hi>Adam,</hi> that vnlesse the Almightie did either assist vs by his Holy spirit, or restraine them in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their skill (especially in spirituall matters, wherewith the naturall man hath no acquaintance;) who could, in any age, be able to discerne their Iugling, much lesse, to avoide their snares, alwayes suited to the present season? Notwithstanding most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that in <hi>Ahabs</hi> as in al other times, tainted with the like or aequiualent sinnes; the Almightie giues them leaue to doe their worst; to practise with such cunning in euery kind, as leaues men, so disposed as these false Prophets were, (vntill they amend) no more possibilitie of distinguishing diuelish suggestions from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracles, than <hi>Ahab</hi> had (without repentance) to escape his doome read by <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Michaiah.</hi> For hee had not fallen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse his Prophets had beene first seduced; Their errour therefore was by Gods iust iudgement, as fatall as his fall; both absolutely ineuitable vpon supposition of their obstinate disobedience to the vndoubted mandates of Gods written law. Thus no one tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of our aduersaries obiections (how the learned should be sure of their interpretations, when others as learned as they are as strongly perswaded to the contrary) but is as directly opposite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the certaintie of true Prophets reuelations; seeing many, yea most of that profession, and (in the iudgement of man) men of better gifts and places then such as prooued true Prophets, were otherwise perswaded; vsually such as the people esteemed best, strangeliest deluded.</p>

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7863:233"/> Or who can hinder his Omnipotency euen in this age to make his power seene in our weaknes? If this his power be not limited now: then may he still both reueale the true sense and meaning of his word in some points, vnto men of lesse capacitie in others; and furnish them with abilitie too, for demonstrating by euidence of argument, and surest grounds of reason vnto others, that this sense must needes be the true sense, and that all other interpretations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the same places, by men otherwise excellent for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and skill in Scripture, cannot stand with those principles of Christian faith, which all sorts of beleeuers stedfastly beleeue.

For none is so absolutely good, none so farre exceedes another; but in part may bee exceeded by him. Nor doth this Christian modestie, which the Scripture thus teacheth, binde any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an soule, or ingenuous minde, to such absolute seruilitie, as the obiection must inforce vpon all, if it proue ought: For there is no ingenuous man, especially of meaner gifts, but will in heart and conscience acknowledge many, both auncient and moderne, for farre more excellent Schollers then himselfe: and yet be fully perswaded in conscience, that in sundrie particulars hee hath the truth on his side which they oppugne; and the true sense of Gods Spirit in some pointes wherein they haue erred, or were ignorant.

The consequence, or corollarie of which two assertions, is againe as euident: [I may without breach of modestie thinke I haue the truth on my side in sundrie particulars, against him that is farre better seene in Scriptures, and other sciences, then my selfe.] For albeit hee were much better seene in both then hee is: yet are his gifts measured as well as mine; although God hath giuen him a greater measure of such gifts, then me. Wherefore, as I would willingly yeeld vnto him in infinite others; so may I safely dissent from him in this or other particulars, that are contained in the small measure of Gods gifts vpon me; without any iust censure of arrogancy, or breach of modesty, for entring the lists of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with him absolutely.

Or if any Iesuite will renounce <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and reuiue the old Academichs opinion, <hi>[That there can be no certaintie of any thing, but onely an opinion:]</hi> our Vniuersities shall be readie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere him, albeit hereby they should disenable their supposed infallible rule as much as ours.

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7863:236"/> For they neither denie a certainty in secular artes, because many erre: nor do they perswade young students in their schooles, to giue ouer their studious and industrious searching into specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue sciences, because many haue taken much paines in them to little purpose: Nor doe they hold it sufficient for good schollers in such matters, to relie wholly on other mens iudgements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any triall of conclusions, or examination of arguments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles of those sciences which they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. In a word, the varietie of opinions hath not yet occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to create a Pope of artes, and secular sciences, albeit such a creature were (by their arguments) much more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, or (at least) lesse harmefull in those faculties, then in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. For in them we haue no promise for the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a secret teacher, the true illuminator of our soules, whose authoritie is as infallible, as the spirit of truth. <hi>Aristotle</hi> takes it for an infallible token that there is a certaintie to be had in sciences, because all men thinke themselues certaine in their perswasions of things that may bee knowne: as well those that know not the truth, but onely thinke they know it, as those that know it indeed. If <hi>Aristotles</hi> argument (which the Iesuites so acknowledge,) bee good: then is their argument in this cause most absurd. Many men (say they) perswade themselues they know the right sense of sundrie places in Scripture, when they do not, therefore no man, no priuate man, no man but the Pope, <hi>(qui neque Deus est neque homo,)</hi> by any search or industrie, can be sure that he hath it. Whereas by <hi>Aristotles</hi> reason, (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a rule of reason) the contrarie rather followes, That there is a certaintie to be had concerning the truth and true sense of Scripture by all such as seeke it aright,) because euen such as erre, and seeke it amisse, are strongly perswaded of their certaintie in it. From the same <hi>Topicke</hi> doe the schoolemen and other iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious contemplators proue a certainty of true and perfect blisse, able alone to satiate the greedie appetite, and stay the vnconstant longing of mans soule, because euen miscreants and such as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably hold on like dromidaries in those vngracious courses, which in wiser heathens sight lead directly vnto infelicitie and true miserie, cannot cast away all conceit of happinesse from which they wander, but rather suppose it to be seated in those sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:7863:237"/> pleasures which they follow. Yet would our aduersaries arguments disprooue all certaintie in apprehension of true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse with greater probabilitie, then they can impeach the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of priuate spirits in any other points of faith, as might (to omit other reasons) bee proued by this one; <hi>Because some of their Popes</hi> (none of which as they suppose can erre in <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie matters of faith) neuer haue any taste or apprehension of true happinesse.</hi>

Such as held a kinde of Purgatorie, or third place after this life, Euangelicall Councels, inuocation of Saints, or the like, because they thought the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught them, were deceiued in these particular Scriptures, but yet reserued their faithfull Allegiance to Gods word in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Nay, euen those particular errours and mistakings of the sense of Scriptures, were witnesses and pledges of their obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scripture, or word of God; when they therefore beleeued them, because they were immediately perswaded in conscience that the Scriptures (the rule of their conscience) did teach them. But while you hold the same opinions, not because you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in conscience (immediately ruled by Scripture) that they are contained in Scripture, but because the Church, which as yee suppose cannot erre, doth teach them; or to speake more plainly, whiles you your selues either beléeue, or teach others to beleeue them or the Scriptures concerning them; because the Church, whose authoritie in this and all other cases you acknowledge for the infallible rule of your faith, commaunds you so to doe: you hereby openly renounce your owne, and sollicite the people to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate their Allegiance from God and his word: and the passing ouer, or yeelding vp of stedfast and absolute assent vnto any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular point in your religion, vpon these groundes, is as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a witnesse of high treason, committed against GOD by the partie thus beleeuing; as swearing of that Fealtie, or Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to a pretended Vicegerent, or Deputie, which is onely due to the Prince himselfe, would be in a naturall and sworne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Wherefore the supposed infallibilitie of your Church is no such excellent meanes of taking vp all controuersies, if your meaning be in the former sense proposed. For it is so farre from taking vp all, that it puts an impossibilitie of hauing any betwixt you and vs taken vp, vnlesse you abiure <hi>it</hi> quite; for it makes all the rest of your opinions deadly, to such as stedfastly beleeue it, or for it, them.</p>

Indeed I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, there would soone be an end of all, or rather, no controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies should euer be begun, if euery man would resolue with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, not to dissent from others, but let them hold what they list, hee would hold the very same: or if all men would binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to abide some one mans, or a <hi>Maior</hi> part of some few or more determinate persons, determinations without more adoe. In this case one might say of his Iudge, Hee shall determine for me; and another might reply, nay but for my opinion; the third might say, Hee shall iudge as I will haue him; and the fourth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, or rather as I will: and yet neuer a one dissent from other, but all agree.

And they that labour for such an vnion in pointes of faith and saluation, doe in effect sollicite the whole Christian world to runne hand in hand, but head-long, into open infidelitie, least perhaps by breaking companies, some might slide into Schismes and Heresies.

I will not abuse the readers patience with allegation of the places, which haue beene very fully answered by many of our Church. That which I intend at this time, is. First, to debarre them by their own groundes of this plea of Scriptures, by shewing their absurditie, and folly, in vrging any Scripture at all for the proofe of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion: And secondly, to ouerthrow the assertion it selfe by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest proofes, that either their Churches transcendent authoritie (as it is now taught) must fall, or Christianitie cannot stand.

                        <p n="6">6 This their assertion being two fold, (for their Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible expositions, and against all priuate interpretations,) is

They are to bee beleeued in exposition of Scriptures <hi>fide diuina,</hi> whom the Holy Ghost infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assists. They are not so to be beleeued, whom the Holy Ghost doth not so assist. Whence what hee said before will follow, that no man, besides the Pope, may beleeue his owne interpretations of Scriptures: His or the Churches all must, nay all men must beleeue <hi>fide diuina,</hi> that the Church or Pope is in all determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons infallibly assisted by the Holy Ghost. For if wee were not bound to beleeue their infallibilitie most infallibly, it could be no rule of faith, but might bee reiected till wee see it euidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; whereas they contend it should be the rule of faith vnto all, and by their owne confession a mayne Article of their Creed: but (according to their positions as we shall hereafter proue) the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Article of Christian faith; how destitute these their assertions are of all groundes of reason, or rules of nature, hath beene made euident.

For thus they make the Scripture a rule of our faith, at the least in this one Article of the Catholique Churches infallibilitie; which, by this assertion, wee may and ought infallibly to beleeue, because the Scriptures, which we first infallibly beleeue, doe teach and proue it. Hence priuate men should be taught by the Holy Ghost, first to beleeue the truth of Scriptures, and for it the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. Wherefore the Scripture must bee the immediate rule of their beliefe in the Article of the Churches infallibilitie, which to them is the generall rule of faith; and so by consequence, the Scriptures which to vs are onely the rule of faith must bee more then so to them, euen the rule of their rule of faith. But if the Scriptures may bee the immediate and infallible rule of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe in this one Article of the Churches infallibilitie; what reason possibly can bee imagined, why they should not bee the infallible and immediate rule of their faith, in all other parts or Articles of their Creede?

Wherefore if the Holy Ghost

                        <p n="10">10 Or if our aduersaries will hold it no absurditie to say, that the holy Ghost may teach vs the true sense and meaning of the fore-mentioned places of Scripture, which seeme to make for the infallibility of the Romish Church, as <hi>Petre pasce oues, &amp;c.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without the helpe or assistance of the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie, (which is heere the lesson supposed to be taught,) and referres all other points of faith or matters of doctrine vnto the Churches teaching immediatly they are bound in reason to shew a Scripture for this assertion.

If a man should goe about to proue that the Prince was sumptuously arrayed, because hee was sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously apparrelled or attired, the proofe would be ridiculous: seeing sumptuous apparrell, and sumptuous array in common speech are all one, &amp; he that knowes the one knowes or beleeues the other. But if a man should say, the Prince was sumptuously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled, because he ware a sute of Tissue, or beset with pearle, the proofe were good, so it could be proued that he wore such a sute. For it is sufficiently knowne to all, that such attire is sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and therefore he that can make proofe that hee was so atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hath sufficiently proued that hee was sumptuously array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus, would our Aduersaries admitte, that eyther the Scriptures wee better knowne then the infallibilitie of the Church; or the Churches infallibilitie better knowne
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7863:254"/> then they the one of them might be brought to proue the other, without any fault in the manner or forme of proofe, howsoeuer their assertions in the proofe of eyther would ouerthrow ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their owne positions, or the principles of faith, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the two former parts of our diuision. But according to our supposition in the third member, to wit, [That the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches infallibilitie, and the infallibilitie of Scripture, are both alike knowne vnto vs, and neyther beleeued from before other,] the verie manner, or forme of promising one by the other, would be as ridiculous and absurde, as if a man should prooue costly apparrell by sumptuous array: Or that one was costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled, because hee wore costly rayment.</p>

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:7863:254"/> reason of our faith. If you be demaunded (for example sake) why you beleeue a Trinitie of persons in one Godhead: First, distinguish whether the question be of your firme and infallible beleefe of this truth it selfe, or of the cause which moued you to imbrace this beleefe. In the former case the answere must be, because God hath reuealed it: If it bee demaunded againe how you know that God hath reuealed it? the answere must be, you know it not euidently, but yet beleeue so, by the same infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible faith by which you beleeued the truth reuealed: and this not by an other Reuelation, but by the Churches infallible proposall of it, which is a condition necessary to such beleefe. If yet it be further questioned, how you know the Churches proposall or auouching of this Reuelation to be infallible? your answere must be againe, that distinctly and clearely you know not thus much, but yet beleeue it as infallibly as the former, and that for the Reuelation of the Scripture, bearing testimony of the Churches infallibility, which Reuelation you beleeue not by any other Reuelation, but for it selfe, although vnto this very beleefe the Churches proposall be required as a necessary condition.</hi>

<pb n="457" facs="tcp:7863:255"/> but more plaine and easie to the capacitie of the vnlearned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Suppose some ambitious Captaine, or Courtier, (for whose integritie no man of place would promise much,) should bring vnto our King, or some States-man in this land, some forraine Princes (as the renowned King of Denmarkes) letters commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datorie, for his great sufficiencie in good place in Warre or State: I would request but any ordinarie Reader well to consider, what manner of resolution it would be, if with reuerence I may suppose that eyther his Maiestie, or any States-man in this land, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of any such place of worth, as this supposed messenger would sue for, might thus resolue: Surely the King of Denmarke is a renowned religious Prince, and one that wisheth exceeding well vnto our King and State, and whatsoeuer he should write in any mans commendations, for his aduancement to such a place as this partie makes suite for, I dare not once call in question, lest I should seeme to disparage his Princely word: but how shall I know that these are his letters, and no counterfaite? If thus hee should doubt, and yet finally rest content with this or like sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; why? doth not he say they are his true letters, whose fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and integritie the King in his letters commends? no man in the world (I thinke) of any ordinarie experience, although hee had neuer trauerst the schooles to know the meaning of a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proofe, but could perceiue this resolution to be but <hi>dolus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatorius:</hi> and he that would be cosened with this or the like, by any traueller of what fashion soeuer, may easily be circumuented by any domesticke Pedlar, or circumforaneall copes-mate. Yet is this resolution in euery point the selfe same with <hi>Valentians</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, concerning the Romane Churches infallibilitie; and the exception which heere he brings, why this resolution of his is none, may altogether as directly and fitly bee brought to shew, that this supposed resolution is no circular resolution. First, let vs parallell the seuerall pars of both resolutions, in that resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith which <hi>Valentian</hi> brings: All Christians beleeue, that whatsoeuer God saith is true; and so in this other resolution it is supposed that his Maiestie or any of his States-men firmely beleeues, that whatsoeuer the King of Denmarke writes or auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in matters of this nature, (as of ciuill integritie, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie for the discharge of such an office) is altogether true, and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7863:256"/> may not be suspected yet may they suspect whether he wrote thus much in this mans commendations, as these letters import, or no. And so saith <hi>Valentian,</hi> &amp; other Papists, all Christians may suspect, (certaine they cannot be) whether God wrote those books which we call Scripture or no. The assurance which Christians in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning faith, and States-men in this present case could haue for their securitie, is altogether the same. For the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no other reason to perswade himselfe, that these are the King of Denmarkes letters, but onely the report, asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or testimonie of this messenger, whose preferment they concerne. And so likewise by the Papists positions, no priuate Christian can haue any other certaine assurance, that these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the word of God, but onely the testimonie or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the present Romish Church, whose state and dignitie they likewise seeke to maintaine by countenance of the Scriptures, whose misse-interpretation did eyther first occasiō, or not hinder, her rising to that height of temporall dignitie which she now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes. Thus finally it appears that all the reason or ground of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, which any Papist following the Iesuites for their instructors can haue, must be the infallibility of the Romish Church, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility therfore cannot be proued out of Scripture, because the Scriptures by their positions cannot bee infallibly proued to be Scriptures, or that authenticke Word which onely can affoorde sure proofe in matters of faith, but by this their Churches sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed authoritie. As for <hi>Valentians</hi> exception, concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse obiect of the Churches Proposall, and the diuine Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by it proposed, the selfe-same diuersitie of obiect may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the former instance of the counterfeit messenger, whose resolution in effect is thus; You must beleeue these letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I commend them vnto you in the King of Denmarkes name, and you must beleeue mee in commending them vnto you because the King of Denmarke, whose words you trust in them, commends my trust and fidelitie. To apply <hi>Valentiaes</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this resolution; As the obiect of that the Church propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, or rather of the Churches proposall, is the diuine reuelation: so likewise is the obiect of this counterfaites proposall the often mentioned kings supposed commendation of him. Againe, as the obiect of the diuine Reuelation is the truth beleeued, <hi>[Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7863:256"/> credita, vt Deum esse trinum &amp; vnum, aut propositionem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae esse infallibilem, as that there is a Trinitie in the Godhead, or the Churches proposall is infallible:]</hi> So likewise the obiect of the kings commendation in the other instance, is the truth beleeued, or that at least which this counterfeit exactes to be beleeued as true to wit, that hee himselfe is a man of excellent partes, and one that will vse fidelitie as well in his doings as sayings, and in a word, one, whose proposall in matters of State or warre, is as infallible as the Popes in matters of faith. Yet notwithstanding that this counterfaites proposall or asseueration, which must be beleeued from the Princes commendation of him, which must be beleeued againe from his proposall, <hi>Non habent vnum &amp; idem obiectum, sed aliud &amp; aliud, haue not one and the same obiect:</hi> yet is the former resolution still ridiculous; and so is <hi>Valentians</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his Catholike faith most ridiculously most impious. For what other issue of such dissolute resolutions can bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but that men who know no better, should hereby bee dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to suspect the Scriptures for counterfeite, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church (if the Romane were onely the Catholike Church) of villanous forgerie, at the least in those places of Scripture which she pretendes for proofe of her owne infallibilitie.</p>
                        <p n="19">19 As for <hi>Valentians</hi> later exception, why his resolution should not bee circular: it is more ridiculous then the former, most ridiculously false (to omit other points) in this one, that he dare denie the Churches proposall by their doctrine to bee the cause, why wee beleeue the diuine Reuelation, or rather that these Scriptures which we haue are diuine Reuelations. For by their positions we cannot assure our selues, that the Scriptures are the word of God, by any other cause or reason, besides the Churches authoritie: and therefore, by their doctrine, the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authoritie of their Church is the onely cause, why wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this sacred Canon of Scriptures, which wee enioy, to bee diuine Reuelations, although it bee no cause by their doctrine, why we beleeue that in generall diuine Reuelations are true.

Doe we not see visible shapes before colours, nor colours before them? no. For we see no visible shapes at all, but by them colours onely are brought into our light: and wee cannot see one before the other, if the one we see not at all. And in like sense it were true, that we should not beleeue the Church before Scriptures, not Scriptures before we beleeue the Church, if we were not bound to beleeue the one at all.

And although I had beene instructed to the contrarie, yet could I haue wished her doctrine true, such was my affection to her shape, as it was falsely represented to my childish fantasie. But after the day-starre had shined in my heart, the former hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherewith the eyesight of my infant minde had beene corrupted, was quickly dispelled. Once able to looke more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into the subtillest of her schoolemens disputes, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine her learned Clearkes Apologies for her, by the Gospels light: I saw clearely, how by presenting mere shewes or shadowes of truth, they led weake-sighted soules into error, as it were in a mist: in the beginning of their works vsually inserting pretended grounds (here and there as they espie occasion) of their intended conclusions, supported with some sleight reasons for the present; feeding vs with expectatiō of better proofes, either in some other work or (a great way after) in the same, which may stay our minds till we come at them, where they returne vs backe againe to what is past, and that being now far off, &amp; most particulars out of mind, may seeme not altogether nothing to such as will not take paines
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7863:259"/> to reuiew it. And thus in fine, as the mist, so their proofes seeme euery where somewhat, till a man come neare them, but then so vanish as he shall see nothing of that he looked for.</p>

As the occasions that breede, so the right meanes to auoid all contentions and schismes, are most perspicuously set down in scriptures, amōgst others most necessary for this purpose, (for the plantation, increase, &amp; strength of true and liuely faith,) sincere obedience to spirituall authoritie is the chiefe. For more willing and chearfull performance hereof, choice should be made of Pastors or ouerseers, qualified as Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires men of so high a calling should be; men not giuen to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels or strife, men of milde &amp; lowly spirits, fearing God and hating couetousnesse; men esteeming the hidden treasure of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at so high a rate, as neither feare of man, nor hopes of any worldly fauour can moue them to hazard or aduenture it. Were these rules, by such as haue the ouersight of Gods flocke, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practised, as they are by Scripture plainly taught the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7863:265"/> of Gods word should daily encrease; pietie, deuotion and Christian charitie continually flourish; all strife and dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quickly fade.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 But if through the default of Princes or Potentates, no fit choice be made of spirituall gouernours, if by their negligence, worse be made of inferiour Ministers: the cause comes not by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution, to be reformed by the congregation: What then must they be altogether silent at such abuse? No; the Scripture hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as plain a rule for their imploymēt as for the others. The more or more often higher powers offend, the more feruently frequent should the lower sort be in powring out<note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1.2</note>

In the meane time albeit they rule otherwise, inferiours should consider, that God giues them such superiours for their pronenesse to disobedience, scurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, scoffing at lawfull authoritie, or other like sinnes, expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by his word. To euery people as well as Israel hee giues such rules in his wrath, as shall not seeke them but theirs, not his glory in their saluation, but their owne glory by their harme.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But as the tongues of inferiours must bee tied from scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing or ieasting at men in authorities bad proceedings: so must not the word of God be bound. If their consciences (rightly and vnpartially examined) direct them otherwise then their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours command, they must (notwithstanding their superiours checks) speake as they thinke, vntill death command them silence; if for the freedome of their speech (vpon good warrant of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science) they be punished, vengeance is Gods, hee will repay su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours for it: vnto whose lawfull authoritie whilst obedience is denied, vpon sinister pretences, or humorous though strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of conscience, counselling vs to the contrarie: our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in this life is iust, whose present smart should teach vs to beware of farre more grieuous in the life to come. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offend or swerue more from the rules of Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed for their seuerall Christian carriage; superiours in commaunding wrongfully; or inferiours in disobeying iust commaunds; cannot oft-times (if wee speake of particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) be infallibily knowne in this life; but must be reserred vnto that day of finall iudgement. The dread of which should in the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7863:266"/> meane time inforce euery superiour daily to consult his owne heart, and strictly to examine his conscience, whether it bee not likely then to giue euidence against him, for imposing too heauie burthens vpon his inferiours. And so must euery inferiour againe vse the like diligence in the daily examination of his conscience, whether it be likely or no to conuince him before the Iudge of quicke and dead, of disobedience to such as he had set in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer him, or of such sinister pretences for vsing the libertie of conscience, as conscience it selfe neuer sought after, but were suggested onely by humour, popularitie, or other desires, whose maintenance haue either inforced him to obey man against God, or not to obey man commanding for God.</p>

Seeing this our great foster-Father is now ignorant of his childrens demeanor, and knowes not me; it shall be my comfort, to haue his honourable successors witnesses of my care and industrie to fulfill his godly desire, whose religious soule in his life time (as his written lawes doe testifie) did detest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then idlenesse in the Ministrie, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his adopted Sonnes. The matters J here present vnto your Lordships &amp; the worlds view, are sometimes in themselues so harsh and hard to be concocted, as he that would striue to make them toothsome vnto nice tastes, should put himselfe to excessiue paines; vnlesse his iudgement be much riper, his wit readier, his inuention pleasanter, his opportunities better, and his leisure greater then mine are.

Many excellent wits and graue Diuines, as well in our English as other reformed Churches, I knew, had accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered the speciall characters of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and demonstrated most properties of great <hi>Antichrist</hi> vpon the <hi>Pope.</hi> But that the fundamentall <hi>charter</hi> of the Romish Church, or the commission pretended by <hi>Iesuites</hi> for the erection of it, should (as the manner was to demolish lesser religious houses for building others more magnificent) extend to raze the very first foundations of religion as common to Christians, Iewes, and Turkes; that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb facs="tcp:7863:271"/> of such infallibilitie as they Deifie her with should be more incompatible with Christianitie then any Idolatrie of the Heathen; that such as absolutely beleeue all her decrees without examination, truely beleeue no article of this <hi>Creede;</hi> with the like principall branches of Antichristianisme; were points, for ought I knew, rather touched by the way, or proposed as clear in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the indifferent and ingenuous, that iudge of the Romish Church by the knowne picture of her misse-shapen limmes, then prosequuted at large, or with purpose to pull off that artificiall painting, wherewith late Iesuites haue so beautified this vgly Monsters face, that the world bewitched with gazing too much on it cānot but loue her other deformities though in themselues most loathsome. For though the practises enioyned by her bee so vile, as would haue caused Rome Heathen to haue blushed at their mention, or her other doctrines so palpably grosse, that her owne Sonnes heretofore haue derided them, and as yet spare to speake ought in particular for their defence: yet to salue all this it must suffice, that the Church, which cannot erre, hath now au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them.</p>
                  <p>If any thinke I preiudice the truth of moderate accusations, by laying such heauie imputations vpon this doctrine, as make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more detestable then any other, hee speakes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequently to his positions, if hee hold the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> was infallibly assisted by the holy Ghost, or that the Pope in <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall</hi> resolutions cannot erre. But, he which thinkes foule impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may bring Romish Prelates out of fauour with the spirit of truth, and make them as obnoxious to errors as others are, or can perswade himselfe, that many practises and opinions, by that Church alreadie authorized, are in their nature abominable and impious, must either accord to me or dissent from Reason, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Religion. For these, so hee will but vouchsafe his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or attention, ioyntly proclaime aloude, that nothing amisse, either in matter of doctrine or manners, can be so detestable with out this presumptuous groundlesse warrant of absolute infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as with it; that albeit a man would set himselfe to practize all particulars directly contrarie to what God hath commanded or to contradict God and his goodnesse, yet his iniquitie without this absolute beliefe of full authoritie deriued from <hi>him</hi> so to doe,
<pb facs="tcp:7863:271"/> would be but as a bodie without a soule, in respect of the Romish Churches impieties, which makes the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> the principall Author of Gods written word the abettor of all her fraude, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, or villanies. Briefly as it is not the doing of those materials God commands vs to doe, but faithfull submission of our wils to his in doing them, which, as <hi>S. Iames</hi> instructs vs, makes vs true Christians: so is it not the doing or maintayning of what God forbids or hates, but the doing of it vpon absolute submission of our soules and consciences to other lawes then he hath left, which makes men liue members of Antichrist, as being animated, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and moued by the spirit of errour. Now this perswasion of absolute infallibilitie and vniuersall warrant from the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, without condition or restraint, being peculiar to the Romish Church, admitting it to be as faultie in practises and as obnoxious to errours as any other, none can be reputed so truly Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as it. For albeit <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretended diuine reuelations, yet his <hi>Priests</hi> challenge no such absolute infallibilitie as doth the Pope; they make no second <hi>Rocks</hi> or foundations, no ordinarie Pastor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiualent to their great <hi>Prophet.</hi> Whence although the Turkes hold opinions in themselues, or materially considered, more grosse, and maintayne some practices not much lesse villanous then Iesuites doe: yet the grounds or motiues of their beliefe, (which are as the soule or spirit of Religion) are nothing so pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, nothing so directly opposite to the holy spirit, as is this Iesuiticall rule of faith. Nor doe they either professe such beliefe in Christ, or acknowledge him for a foundation so elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as brings them within the Temple of God, within which vnlesse Antichrist sit his contrarietie vnto Christ could not bee so essentiall, so immediate or direct, as by the rules of sacred Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie we are taught it must be. Yet I know not, whether the indignitie of this doctrine is more apt to affect Diuines or Men rightly religious and fearing God, then the sottishnesse of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perswade it, to prouoke the iust indignation of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Artists, which cannot endure, though in matters of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, to captiuate their vnderstandings to positions deuoide of sense. To require some probabilitie of reason, ciuill or naturall, is on their part no insolent demand, for exchange of Christian faith or aduenturing their inassurance of life eternall in the seruice
<pb facs="tcp:7863:272"/> of meere forrainers whom they neuer saw. Yet vnto perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie resolutions no lesse dangerous, doe Iesuites solicite vs, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any tollerable shew of probabilitie but quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Gods principall lawes and our naturall notions of good and euill; as by these labours euery Academique may in part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, but more fully, if he would vouchsafe to sift more of their arguments, then in these short transcursiue disputes I could. Nor would I disswade any Artist well grounded in <hi>Aristotle</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsing the most learned workes any Romanist hath written in this argument. In most other controuersies betwixt vs and them it is dangerous, I must confesse, euen for well grounded Artists to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with their writings, not so in this: for I protest in the sight of God and his holy Angels, that as farre as I can remember the inclinations of my youth, or by them prognosticate how after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I might haue beene affected, I neuer was, I neuer should haue beene, so throughly possessed with such great di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>like of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Antichristianisme in this point, by hearing the most famous Preachers in this Land, or reading all the learned Writers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, as I was by examining the labours of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Valentian,</hi> and others of best note amongst them seriously addressed to this purpose; comparing them only with the known principles of Christianitie and such passages of sacred Writ, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Christian Artist should be acquainted with. For the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whereon I proceede, I haue beene only beholden to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scriptures; for deducing of such blasphemous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from them, as I charge the Aduersarie with, only to that small measure of knowledge in Aristotelian Philosophie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with my God had blessed mee, whiles I was bound by locall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to the studie of Artes, purposely abstaining from other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which with their informations of my vnderstanding might haue bred preiudice in my affection. Since that time, although the yeares of my Ministrie hardly exceede the space of ordinarie apprentiships, yet haue I often wished the discussion of these points had beene then imposed vpon mee by some experienced Diuine, that would only haue giuen me right hold of their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Vpon this consideration I would beseech the flourishing Artists of this famous <hi>Academie,</hi> whom God hath furnished with all store of munition necessarie for this seruice, not to neglect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb facs="tcp:7863:272"/> present. Let them deferre (if so they please) the fruits of their labours in other points (though this be the fault of our English) vntill the <hi>Autumne</hi> of their age. But the marke I now propose vnto them, being the euident resolution of Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call positions into those grosse and palpable blasphemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they tend, which they only seeke to hide by Sophismes and artificiall tricks of wit, Academicall wits might displume them of these figge-tree leaues and manifest their nakednes to the world, much better in the spring whiles their skill in artes were fresh and flourishing, whiles the strength and vigour of their inuention would more easily bend this way, then in the <hi>Autumne,</hi> when their leaues begin to fade and their sap retire to the root, as their pleasant grapes grow ripe. Many towardly plants in this nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, now able to match the stoutest Iesuite liuing at his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, whilest in his mature age, <hi>multo iam fractus membra labore,</hi> more fit to be a Leader, then a combatant in these encounters, he shall looke back on his former labours or cals to minde his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted dexteritie in Schoole disputes, may take vp old <hi>Nestors</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>

Yet such is the brittlenesse of the matter they are to worke vpon in this controuersie, that were all the Priests and Iesuites harboured within the confines of great Brittaine at this present day, but enioyned to write all they could to any purpose in defence of their Mother; some few Artists of those Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which out of their pride they seeme to vilifie amongst the ignorant, would, I dare not say make them blush (for sooner might they make a black-moores face of the same colour with his teeth) but as many of their fauourers of this Kingdome, as haue not sworne allegeance to the Church of Rome, and are able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb facs="tcp:7863:273"/> an argument, to bee ashamed on their behalfe, euen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that for ought these Mounte-bankes could say or write in their defence, the Positions maintayned by their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> forraine Iesuites, were indeed idolatrous and blasphemous; howbeit the Church it selfe, wee must beleeue, could neuer bee vanquished, because no man can tell where or in what shape to finde it.</p>
                  <p>Nor neede yong Artists feare the countenance of antiquitie in this point, from which their enemies supplies are so slender, that would they come to open triall, and bring only such of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their seconds, as liued within fiue hundred yeares of Christ, or before the mixture of Romish Religion with Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, not fully effected till a little after that time: the paucitie of those whose aide they durst solicit, in respect of that great armie, which is as resolute as wee against them, would make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly either yeeld themselues, or forsake the field. Nor haue they beene hitherto able to addresse any answere; but to their shame, to the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the English Church, whose labours haue made the conquest in this quarrell easie to any of their successors, that will aduenture to follow their steps. Nothing remaines but what best becomes the exercise of yong wits; to exceede the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall disputes of Iesuites against the truth, in copiousnesse of irrefragable demonstrations, that the allegeance they seeke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish vnto the <hi>Romish</hi> Church is solemne apostasie from Christ; that the beliefe of it is the very abstract of sorcerie, the vtmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Antichristianisme that can bee expected. These and like points, being fortified by strength of argument, in the time of your Regencie or fare-well to the studie of Artes, might bee po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at your better leisure, afterwards to be reuised and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the appointment of authoritie. Or if the zeale of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thus mightily eclipsed by this foule Idoll of the Romish Church doe not as yet so fully moue you; yet that indignation which first wrought a desire in mee of giuing this onset, should worke (me thinks) in euery heart, that beares any sparkle of loue vnto his natiue Countrie. For what indignitie is it to thinke, that whilst our gracious Soueraigne is a most zealous Professor and Defendor of the truth we teach; so many of his naturall subiects our Countrimen and Brethren, should bee wonne vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb facs="tcp:7863:273"/> faction, especially by importunate inculcating two heresies, of all maintayned by that Church, in themselues most sottishly improbable; and yet apparently most damnable Idolaters in their consequences; if erroneous: I meane this concerning their Churches absolute priuiledge from all errour, and that other of Christs reall presence in the Sacrament, by transubstantiation. It cannot againe but adde much to our griefe and indignation, if we call to minde, how, when the chiefe <hi>Gouernour</hi> and publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of this Land were for them, subscription was not vrged vpon such violent and bloudie termes vnto any articles of their Religion, as vnto that of reall presence. The mysterie of which iniquitie cannot better bee resolued then into the powerfull and deceitfull working of Satan, thus delighting to despite our Lord and Sauiour by seducing his professed subiects vnto the highest and most desperate kinde of rebellion he could imagine, vpon the least occasions and shallowest reasons. For such is their madnesse in that other point, as hath beene shewed in this: Not one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience they can obiect to our opinion, but may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against theirs; not any fruits of godlinesse they can pretend but our doctrine more directly brings forth then theirs could, though we did admit it for true. For to what other purpose such a presence as they imagine should serue them, saue only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance those desperate Idolatrous practices and litourges of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, touched by the way in some parts of these discourses, is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable; as shall be shewed more at large (without depriuing that heauenly mysterie of any solemnitie or deuotion due vnto it) in the vnfolding of that controuersie.</p>

                     <p n="8">8 It is further added in the same place, (because I take it had beene specified in a Synode before) that <hi>no man shall dare to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scriptures against the vnanimous consent of Fathers.</hi> Which I

Whence it is euident, that we should not alwayes interprete Scriptures against the ioint consent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, albeit wee went against all the particular interpretations which they haue brought; because they were more desirous to haue the truth fully sifted, then their coniecturall probabilities infallibly beleeued: Nor were it possible more to contradict most of them, then by following their interpretations, vpon such strict tearmes, as the Romanists would binde all men to doe, when they seeme to make for their aduantage.

For this is the very abstract, or abridgement of that infinite prerogatiue, which she challengeth, <hi>all men must infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly beleeue that to be Gods Word which she commends, that not to be his Word which she disclaimes for such.</hi> So as onely, the former transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and indeterminate truth <hi>[Whatsoeuer God saith is true]</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the Popes vnlimited, transcendent, roiall sentence; no other word, or syllable of truth, which wee can imagine, God hath or might haue spoken since the World began, either by his owne or his sonnes mouth, by the Ministery of his Angels, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles or Euangelists; but is euery way absolutely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Popes Monarchichall censure.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 And heere, let not the Reader mistake it, as any argument of our aduersaries ingenuity, that they will for their owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vouchsafe to grant (what no heathen Idolater did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) <hi>Whatsoeuer God saith is true.</hi> For, vnlesse this were granted by all; the Pope could haue no possible grounds of pretence, or claime, to his absolute infallibility, or infinite supremacie ouer all. And that which his hirelings seeke to build vpon the former foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is, <hi>Whatsoeuer the Pope hath said, or shall say, ex cathedra, is most true;</hi> because, if we descend to any determinate truthes, wee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7863:286"/> must beleeue that God hath spoken all, and onely that, which the Pope hath alreadie testified, or, (when any question ariseth shall testifie he hath spoken. In fine, the present Pope, by their positions, is Gods onely liuing mouth, onely alsufficient to iustifie, or authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically witnesse all his wordes past: all which, without him, are vnto vs, as dead. Whence they must of necessitie, admit the same proportion, betwixt the present Popes and Gods acknowledged written word, or supposed vnwritten veritie, which in ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we make betwixt a credible mans personall auouchment, or liuing testimonie of what he hath seene, heard, or knowne by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted experience, and another mans heresay report, either of the matters he spake of, his speeches <hi>themselues,</hi> or their true sence and meaning, after his death.

And for this reason, must bee acknowledged a most absolute Iudge of Gods written and vnwritten words, aswell of their Spirituall sence and meaning, as of their outward frame or visible character. This is the height of their iniquitie and will inferre more then our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed conclusion in this Section, <hi>That euen of such places, as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them for Gods Word, we must not beleeue any determinate sence or meaning, but what the Pope shall expressely giue or may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to allow of.</hi>

But the Pope, vpon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies arising, propounds a sence of these writings, or of some part of them, quite contrarie to that which brought the former comfort to our soules; a sence, to all vnpartiall sences, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie to the places iointly acknowledged for Gods Word. A sence, the more wee thinke on in sobrietie, the more wee dislike; a sence, the more earnestly we pray to God for his Spirits assistance, and other good meanes for the right vnderstanding of his Word, and encrease of faith, the more stil we distaste and loath.

But of such as euer had, or hope to haue, any tast or relish of Gods Spirit should resolue absolutely to beleeue his interpretation of any place of Scripture, contrarie to that life-working sence, which must bee in euery heart endued with hope of seeing God: that mans disloialtie towards God and his Holy Spirit, is as impudent, as if a poore subiect should reply vnto his Prince, commanding him in expresse termes to doe thus, or so, I will not beleeue your wordes haue any such meaning as they naturally import; but a contrarie, such as one of my fellow

The first proposition in this Syllogisme is certaine amongst all; the second likewise amongst Catholickes is most firme, as being supported by the testimonie of the Church, Councell, or Pope: of whose immunitie, from possibilitie of erring we haue expresse promises in the Scriptures, as,</hi>

For, vnto vs, that onely, which the Church auoucheth is certaine, and vnfallible; that sence of it, which the Church giues, onely sound; if we speake of any particular or determinate truthes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 How certaine and vnfallible assent vnto all, or any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may bee wrought in mens heartes, without any infallible teacher, alreadie hath beene, and hereafter shall be (God willing) in more particular sort exemplified. In this place, it stood the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit vpon, to haue giuen a better solution to the doubt obiected; which he is so farre from vnloosing, that hee rather knits it faster; as shall appeare, if the Reader will first cal to minde; That for the establishing of firme and vndoubted assent to any truth proposed, it skils not how infallible the truth in it selfe or the proposer be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7863:288"/> they, whose beleefe or assent is demanded, be as infallibly perswaded of this infallibilitie in the truth, or the proposer. In this respect, our aduersaries pleade their immunitie from errour, as an article necessarie to be infallibly beleeued, for confirmation of Gods Word, alwayes most infallible (as all grant) in it selfe, but not so (as they affirme) to vs, vntill it bee auouched by infallible authoritie.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Herein they concurre with vs; both with the truth, That if, we beleeue it onely as probable, that God spake all those wordes, which wee acknowledge to bee most infallible, because his, our beleefe notwithstanding is not infallible, but probable, or conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturall. For as a man may haue bad desires of things essentially good; so may he haue vncertaine perswasions of truthes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues most certaine. It is not therefore the supposed infallibilitie of the Church or Pope, howsoeuer, but infallibly apprehended and beleeued that must strengthen our faith, which otherwise (as is pretended) would be but coniecturall. And by the former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (acknowledged aswell by them as vs) it necessarily followes, that if we be only probably, not infallibly perswaded, the Pope or Church cannot erre; our assent vnto the minor proposition .i. <hi>[vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any determinate part of Gods Word,]</hi> is onely probable not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. For, by the Iesuites Doctrine, we cannot bee certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that God spake this, or that, but by the Churches testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. The immediate consequence of which two assertions, compared together, is, wee cannot bee more certaine that God hath spoken this or that, then wee are of the Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If then wee bee onely probably, not infallibly, perswaded, that the Church is infallible: our beleefe of the minor proposition (that is of any determinate truth which men suppose God hath spoken) must bee onely probable, or coniecturall, not infallible. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to these collections, the learned Papists generally holde, that the Churches infallibilitie must be absolutely and infallibly beleeued; (as you heard before out of<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p n="5">5 The proposed inconuenience wee may deriue from this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie; <hi>How the Papists themselues can attaine to the infallible beleefe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7863:289"/> of the Churches infallible authoritie?</hi> The Church, they thinke, hath a publique spirit; and publique spirits they know are infallible; hence they may perswade themselues the Church is infallible, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the same termes, they beleeue it hath a publique spirit, if their beleefe of this latter be but coniectural; their assent vnto the former can be no better. Seeing then they must of necessitie grant (for this is the principall marke they aime at) that all must infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beleeue the Church hath a publique spirit: the difficultie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues to this point, how this infallible perswasion is, or may bee wrought in them. Either it must be grounded vpon Scriptures, or not: auouched vnto them and wrought in their hearts it must be, either by a publique or priuate spirit. Let vs examine all the parts of this diuision.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 First if priuate mens infallible perswasion of the Churches publike, or authentike spirit, be not groūded vpon Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by vs and them: the Churches authoritie without all controuersie, is much greater then the authoritie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if it, by this assertion, can be any, and the Churches not all in all. For vnto that which men cannot know, whether it bee true or false, they cannot be bound to yeeld absolute or immediate obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: vnto that authoritie, which they absolutely beleeue as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, they are bound to yeeld infallible assent, and absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience directly, in it selfe and for it selfe. But by this supposition men cannot know Scriptures infallibly without the Churches authoritie, and yet they must infallibly beleeue the Churches au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie without Scriptures; The Scriptures authoritie therefore is either lesse then the Churches, or none at all.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 But be it supposed that priuate mens infallible beleefe of the Churches publike spirit is groūded vpon Scriptures, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by vs and vrged by them to this purpose, as vpon these, it <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to the Holy Ghost &amp; vs; I haue prayed for thee thy faith should not faile:</hi> The question whereunto wee demaund an answere, is whether this infallible beleefe of the Churches authoritie, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon these places, must be wrought in mens heartes by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate or publique spirit. If by a priuate spirit onely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the Churches publique spirit, or those Scriptures truth, or true meaning, whereon he grounds it: Hee and all other Papists (such as hee was when hee deliuered this Doctrine;) neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7863:289"/> nor Cardinals, are subiect to the same inconueniences, which he hath condemned vs for, as Heretiques. For all priuate spirits, by his positions, are obnoxious to errour, vnsufficient to plant any infallible perswasion in matters of faith; yet such is this article of the Churches authentique spirit, of which vnlesse men be so perswaded, infallibly perswaded, they cannot bee of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor proposition in any Syllogisme; wherein a point of faith is concluded: and vncertaine of the minor, they cannot be certaine of the conclusion, which, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> rightly obserues, alwayes followes the weaker part. The infallible conclusion therefore of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> resolution, is; vnlesse priuate men may haue publique spirits to warrant the truth of Scriptures, and the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie thereon grounded; they cannot truly beleeue any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of faith. It remaines then we inquire; what inconuenience wil follow, if they admit priuate men to be partakers of publike spirits.</p>

See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this spirit is one and the same, if it can make the Church or Pope infallible in all; why may it not make all priuate men (by this supposition partakers of it) alike infallible, at the least in the right vnderstanding of those places, which warrāt the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie or publique spirit. For our aduersaries, I hope, will easily grant, that the Churches publique and authentique spirit must be most infallibly beleeued, because so expressely taught in those Scriptures cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to this purpose. If this publike or authentique spirit, can worke such infallible apprehension of those places true meaning in priuate heartes, why not in all others as necessarie for them to know; that is, in all necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

Wherefore his authoritie must be vnto vs altogether as great, as the authoritie of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is vnto him; which is farre greater vnto him, then it is or can be to any others; for euen that which is acknowledged for Gods Word, both by him and vs, must be lesse authentique vnto vs then the wordes of this mortall man;</p>
                        <p n="10">10 For though we pardon our aduersaries their former absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, in seeking to prooue the Churches authoritie by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Scriptures by the Churches; though we grant them all they can desire (euen what shall appeare in due place to be most false,) That, whiles they beleeue the Popes particular iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or decisions, from a presupposal of his vniuersal transcendent authoritie, they doe not onely beleeue him, or his wordes, but those partes of Gods Word, vpon which they seeme to ground his infallibilitie: yet our former argument holdes still most firme; because that absolute assent, which priuate men must giue vnto these supposed grounds of their Religion, before other portions of Scripture, is not grounded vpon any preheminencie incident to these words as they are Gods, as if they were more his then the rest, in some such peculiar sort, as the Tenne Commaundements are in respect of other <hi>Mosaicall</hi> Lawes; nor from any internall proprietie flowing from the wordes themselues, as if their secret character did vnto faithfull mindes, bewray them to be more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine then others; nor from any precedent consequent, or comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant circumstance, probably arguing that sence, the Romish Church giues of them, to be of it selfe more perspicuous or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, then the naturall meaning of most other Scriptures, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by one and the same spirit, all, for their forme, of equall authoritie and perspicuitie. All the prerogatiue then, which these passages can haue before others, must be from the matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them; and that, by our aduersaries position, is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches infallibilitie. Wherefore, not because they are Gods word, or were giuen by his Spirit, in more extraordinarie sort then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7863:291"/> but because they haue more affinitie with the Roman Lord, in late yeares exalted aboue all that is called God, Father, Sonne, or Holy Ghost: these places aboue cited, must bee more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikely beleeued, then all the wordes of God besides. As I haue read of pictures, though not more artificiall in themselues, yet helde in greater estimation amongst the Heathen, and freer from contemptuous censure then any other of the same Painters doing, onely because they represented their great God <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11 Another difficultie, whereunto we demand an answere is, whether whiles they assent, as they professe, not onely to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie taught (as they suppose) in the fore cited places, but also vnto the infallibilite of Scriptures which teach it: they acknowledge two distinct assents, or but one. If but one, let them shew vs how possibly the Church can bee said to confirme the Scriptures: if two, let them assigne the seuerall properties of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whether is more strong; whether must bee to the other as <hi>Peter</hi> to his brethren; or if neither of them can confirme the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let them declare how the one can be imagined as a meane or condition of beleeuing the other.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 An Heretikes beleefe of the minor proposition in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Syllogisme (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is but weake: A Romanists be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the same most strong. Let this bee the Minor, <hi>Peter feed my sheepe, or</hi> Peter <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile:</hi> what reason can be imagined, why a Romanists beleefe of these propositions should bee so strong, and ours so weake? The one hath the Churches authoritie to confirme his faith, the other hath not. What is it then to haue the Churches authoritie, onely to know her decrees concerning those portions of Scriptures? If this were all, we know the Romish Churches decrees aswel as the Romanists: but it is nothing to know them, if we doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them. To haue Churches authoritie then is, to beleeue it as infallible: and for this reason is a Romane Catholikes beleefe of any portion of Scripture, more certaine and strong, because hee hath the testimonie of the Church, which he beleeues to be most infallible: and beleeuing it most infallibly he must of necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that to be Scripture, that in euery place, to be the meaning of the Holy Ghost, which this Church commends vnto him for such. Let the most learned of our aduersaries here resolue the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7863:291"/> doubt proposed; whether there bee two distinct assents, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the forementioned propositions: one vnto the truth of the proposition it selfe, and another vnto the Churches infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. It is euident by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, that all the certaintie a Roman Catholique hath aboue a Sectarie is, from the Churches infallibilite. For the proposition it selfe he can beleeue no better then an Heretique may, vnlesse hee better beleeue the Church, i. he beleues the Churches exposition of it, or the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie concerning it, better then the proposition it selfe in it selfe and for it selfe. And so it is euident that the Churches authoritie is greater, because it must be better beleeued.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 Suppose then one of our Church, which beleeues these propositions to be the word of God, should turne Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, his former beleefe is by this meanes become more strong and certaine. This granted, the next question is, what should be the obiect of this his strong beleefe; the propositions beleeued: <hi>Peter feed my sheepe, I haue prayed for thee:</hi> or any other part of Gods written word; or the Churches authoritie; not the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions themselues, but onely <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church confirmes them to him. For suppose the same man should eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones, either altogether reuolt from that Church, or doubt of her authoritie, his beleefe of the former propositions becomes hereby as weake as it was before: which plainely euinceth, that his beleefe of the Church and this proposition, were two distinct beleefes, and that this strong beleefe was fastened vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches authoritie, not vnto the proposition it selfe immediately, but onely <hi>by accident,</hi> in as much as the Church which he beleeueth so firmely, did teach it; for his beleefe, if fastened vpon the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe, after doubt mooued of the Churches authoritie, would haue continued the same, but now (by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> assertion) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as hee begins to disclaime his beleefe of the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, his former strong beleefe of the supposed proposition begins to faile, and of this failing no other reason, then alreadie is, can be assigned. The reason was, because the true, direct, and proper obiect of his stronge beleefe was the Churches authoritie, on which the beleefe of the proposition did intirely depend, as the conclusion doth vpon the premisses, or rather as euery particular doth on the vniuersall, whereunto it is essentially subordinate.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we racke the former syllogisme a little farther, and stretch it out in euerie ioynt to it full length: wee may quickly make it confesse our proposed conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and somewhat more. The Syllogisme was thus, <hi>Whatsoeuer God hath spoken is most true. But God hath spoken, and caused to be written all those wordes contained in the Canon of Scriptures, acknowledged by opposite religions of these times. Therefore these wordes are most true.</hi> The certaintie of the Minor depends, as our aduersaries will haue it, vpon the present Romish Churches infallibilitie, which hath commended vnto vs these Bookes for Gods Word. Bee it then granted, for disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sake, that we cannot know any part of Gods Word, much lesse the iust bounds, extent or limits of all his words supposed to be reuealed for our good, but by the Romish Church: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall sence, or true meaning of all, most, or many parts of these determinate Volumes, and visible Characters, as yet is vndeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and vncertaine; whereas all points of beleefe must bee grounded on the determinate and certaine sence of some part of Gods Word reuealed; for our aduersaries acknowledge all points of faith should bee resolued into the first truth. Hence, if wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to any particular or determinate conclusion of faith, it must be gathered in his Syllogisme, <hi>Whatsoeuer the Church teacheth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the determinate and true sence of Scriptures, whereon points of Faith are grounded, is most true. But the Church teacheth thus and thus,</hi> (for example her owne authoritie is infallibly taught by the Holy Ghost in these wordes, <hi>Peter feede my sheepe,</hi> Peter <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith should not faile) goe: this sence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these wordes is most true.</hi> And as true as it is, must the sence likewise of euery proposition, or part of Scripture by this Church expounded or declared, be accounted.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Maior proposition of this Syllogisme, is as vndoubted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7863:292"/> amongst the Roman Catholiques, as the maior of the former was vnto all Christians: but as yet, the minor; <hi>The Church doth giue this or that sence of this or that determinate place,</hi> may be as vncertaine indeed, as they would make our beleefe vnto the minor proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the generall Syllogisme, before it bee confirmed by the Churches authoritie. For how can we be certain that the Church doth teach all those particulars which the Iesuites propose vnto vs? wee haue Bookes indeede, which goe vnder the name of the Trent Counsell, but how shall wee know that this Counsell was lawfully assembled, that some Canons haue not beene foisted in by priuate Spirits, that the Councell left not some vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for explicating their decrees, after another fashion then the Iesuites doe? who shall assure vs in these or like doubtes? The present Church? All of vs cannot repaire to Rome: such as can, when they come thither, cannot bee sure to heare the true Church speake <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> If the Pope send his Writs to assure vs, what Critcicke so cunning as to assure vs, whether they be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentike or counterfeite? Finally, for all that can bee imagined in this case, onely the Maior of the Catholicke syllogisme, indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is certaine; and consequently no particular or definite conclusion of faith, can be certaine to a Romanist, because there are no possible meanes of ascertaining the Minor, <hi>[What the true Church doth infallibly define]</hi> vnto his Conscience.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Or if they wil hold such conclusions,<note place="margin">Wherein the Papists make the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Gods.</note> as are ordinarily gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Trent Councell, or the Popes decisions, as infallible points of faith: they make their authoritie to be farre greater then the infallibilitie of Gods written word; yea more infallible then the Deitie. This Collection they would denie, vnlesse it followed from their owne premisses; These for example, <hi>That a conclusion of faith cannot be gathered, vnlesse the minor (God did say this or that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately) be first made certaine. But from the Pope or Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, conclusions of faith may be gathered, albeit the minor be not certaine de fide.</hi> For who can make a Iesuites report of the Popes Decrees, or an Historicall relation of the Trent Councell, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>de fide,</hi> as certaine as an Article of faith: And yet the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trent Councell, and Popes Decrees, must bee held <hi>de fide,</hi> vpon paine of damnation, albeit men take them onely from a Priests mouth, or vpon a Iesuites faith and credit.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:7863:293"/>4 This is the madnesse of that Antichristian Synagogue, that acknowledgeth Gods Word for most infallible, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which wee haue, for his word, if it selfe bee infallible. For it tels vs, they are such: yet will not haue collections, or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with equall probabillitie deduced thence, so firmely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by priuate men, as the collections or conclusions, which are gathered from the Churches infallibilitie. An implicit faith of particulars, grounded vpon the Churches generall infallibilitie, so men stedfastly beleeue it, may suffice. But implicit faith of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, grounded onely vpon our generall beleefe of Gods infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libilitie, prouidence, or written word, sufficeth not. This prooues the authoritie of the Church, to be aboue the authoritie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or the <hi>Deitie,</hi> absolutely considered, not only in respect of vs, [that is all besides the Pope and his Cardinals.] For that is of more authoritie absolutely, not onely in respect of vs, which vpon equall notice or knowledge, is to be better beleeued, more estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or obeyed; but such is the authoritie of the Church in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the diuine authoritie; such is the authoritie of the Popes Decrees in respect of Gods Word. For the Minor proposition in both the former Syllogismes being alike vncertaine; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must bee more certaine in that Syllogisme, whose maior relies vpon the Popes infallibilitie then in the other, whose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior was grounded vpon the infallibilitie of the <hi>Deitie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5 Briefly, to collect the summe of all; The authoritie of the Church is greater then the authoritie of Scriptures, both in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of faith, and Christian obedience. In respect of faith; because we are bound to beleeue the Churches decisions, read or explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, <hi>(by the Popes messenger though à Sir Iohn Lack-lattin)</hi> without any appeale: but no part of Scripture, acknowledged by vs and them, we may beleeue, without appeale, or submission of our interpretation to the Church, albeit the true sence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it seeme neuer so plain, vnto priuate consciences in whom Gods Spirit worketh faith. The same argument is most firme and euident, in respect of obedience;</p>
                        <p n="6">6 That authoritie ouer vs is alwayes greatest, vnto which wee are to yeeld most immediate, most strict and absolute obedience: but by the Romish Churches Doctrine, wee are to yeelde su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and most absolute obedience, to the Church; more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7863:293"/> and absolute then vnto Gods word: therefore the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church is greater ouer vs. The Maior is out of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, seeing greatnesse of authoritie is alwayes measured by the manner of obedience due vnto it. The Minor is as euident from the former reason; Our obedience is more absolute and strict vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that authoritie, from which in no case we may appeale, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that from which wee may in many safely appeale: but, by the Romish Churches doctrine, there lies alwayes an appeale from that sence and meaning of Scriptures, which Gods spirit and our owne conscience giues vs, vnto the Churches authoritie; none, from the Churches authoritie or meaning vnto the Scriptures, or our owne consciences.</p>

What then might euery Minister of Christ, euerie distributer of Gods secrets, haue vsed the like authoritie, before the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatiue did; at least, by tacite consent, approue the practise? This place doubtlesse proues, either altogether nothing, or thus much, for the Apostles wordes are indefinite, for their litterall sence, equally appliable to euerie faithfull Minister, or priuate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser of such secrets; not appropriate to the intire publique bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Ecclesiastique, or the capitall or Cardinall partes thereof.

So the

Whatsoeuer the number or qualitie of the guests bee; the great Lords Table must be alwaies so furnished as it was at the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for he hath no respect of persons. If a rich stately Prelate come in with a gold ring in goodly vestiments, &amp; a poore honest Layicke in vile raiments, he saith not to him in Pontificiall roabes, come sit you here at my messe, where you may drinke of my wine aswell as eate of my bread: nor to the poore Layicke, stand thou there a part, or sit downe here vnder my footstoole, where thou maist bee partaker of the crummes which fall from my table, though not of my cup, which must be kept for thy betters. High and low, rich and poore, all were redeemed with one price, all at this offering equal, all alike free to tast of euery dish, so they come with wedding garments, without which euen the best must be cast out, as vnworthie to tast of any part, if not of all. That part, which the Counsels of Constance and Trent, vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of reuerence to the LORDS Supper, haue detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Moderne Christians, the Corinthians had receiued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7863:300"/> vnworthily; yet was not the Cuppe, for this reason, held super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who onely sought to represse the abuse, as knowing the vse of it to bee most necessarie. The matters then hee meant to order, when he came, was, to set out this Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquet with greater decencie and solemnitie, not to abridge them, of any substantiall or materiall part thereof.</p>
                        <p n="17">17 Nor doe the Trent Fathers, if wee may trust them vpon their<note n="*" place="margin">Cited in the precedent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag. 15.</note> words. For they (desirous as it seemes to make the whole Christian World as sottish, as themselues were impious) would make men beleeue, they could iuggle away the Cuppe, and neuer touch the very substance of the Sacrament; as if the wine were not as substantiall a part of the Lords Supper, as was his bloud of his bodie, or humanitie. An integrall or materiall part they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denie it to bee; and such if it bee, there Apologie is as shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as if a man should let out most of anothers bloud, cut of his arme, or legge, or maime him in some principall part, and plead for himselfe, I did not meddle with his substance, meaning (as the Councell I take it heere doth) his essence, seeing he is yet as truly a reasonable Creature, as before.</p>
                        <p n="18">18 But to debarre them of that refuge,<note place="margin">That the Cup is an essentiall and substantial part of the Eucharist.</note> it may be they sought or their followers may yet hope to finde in the equiuocation of this word, <hi>substance,</hi> importing as much sometimes as a material, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral, sometimes as an essential part. If the cup be an essential and substantiall part of this Sacrament, the Councell by their owne confession did fouly erre, in prohibiting Communion vnder both kindes: If no such part it bee, they might by their owne rule haue altogether denied the vse of it so much as to the sacrificer, or conficient: but so the verie vse and end, on which the essence of the Sacrament, (as of all other matters of moral practise) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly depends, and by whose expiration instantly must determine, should vtterly haue perished. The end and vse of this sacred institution, as our Sauiour expressely teacheth, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell grants, was to represent the testators death, yea so to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it, as we migh be partakers of his bodie and bloud, not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually onely, but withall, (as the Trent Fathers contend) sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. Admitting then all they can pretend against the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the Cuppe [That whole Christ were in the bread alone;] yet this will not preserue the true and fruitfull vse of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7863:301"/> the Sacrament, nor salue that deadly wound, the essence of it must perforce receiue from frustration of the end, necessarily ensuing the cuppes absence. For this Sacrament was ordained, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, so to exhibit Christs bodie, vnto all faithfull Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants not as intire, and whole; his bloud, not as it was inclosed in the vaines: but the one, as torne and rent, the other, as shedde and powred out vpon the crosse. <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (saith our Sauiour) <hi>which is shed for many,</hi> (for all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it faithfully) <hi>for the remission of sinnes.</hi> His bloud then, as shed and powred out, is as the loadstarre of penitent and contrite hearts, whereon the eyes of their faith, that seeke remission of sinnes in this Sacrament, must bee fastened: for (as the<note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22.</note> Apostle saith) <hi>without sheding of bloud is no remission.</hi> This was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of that inestimable all-sufficient Sacrifice, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents his precious bloud thus powred out, the principall part of this Sacrament, aswell in respect of representing his death, as in applying remission of sinnes thereby in generall purchased, and by this Sacramentall Type sealed to euery one in particular; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the Trent Councels Doctrine be true, that Christs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bloud, which was shed vpon the crosse, is really present in the Chalice, and might be as immediately sprinkled at least vpon the lips or dores of euerie faithfull receiuers heart, as the bloud, of the Paschal Lambe was vpon the doore-posts of the Israelites. Thus, as Sathan the <hi>Father</hi> of lies, so false opinion, suggested by him, draw men with pleasure into those euils, for whose practise in the end they become their chiefe accusers. That opinion which first brought in neglect of the Chalice, and, as the Trent Councell presumed, would haue warranted them in making this decree, doth most condemne them: for the measure of their iniquitie, could not haue beene so fully accomplished, vnlesse they had held a transubstantiation of the wine into Christs bloud.</p>

Suppose then these two contradictorie propositions, <hi>[The deniall of the cup is a mutilation of Christs last will and testament: the deniall of the cuppe is no mutilation of Christs last will, and Testament,]</hi> were, for their speculatiue probabilities, in iust examination, equipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; yet the doctrine of faith deliuered in Scripture, reason and conscience, without contradiction, instruct vs, that to alter, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, or mutilate the sonne of Gods last will and testament, is a most grieuous, most horrible, most dreadfull sinne; but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the vse of the Chalice, hath no suspition of any the least euill in it. Had the Trent Fathers thus done, they had done no worse then our Sauiour, then his Apostles, then the Primitiue Church, (by<note n="*" place="margin">

With much greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, might the Romanists seeke to establish a perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient Christian charity in <hi>Peters</hi> successors, had <hi>Peters</hi> loue, or charity only failed. But the bad liues and manners of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Clergie, would giue too manifest euidence against them in this attempt: In this respect haue these stout challengers taken vpon them the defence, of a neuer failing faith, because not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily confuted. For, it is a matter very hard (I must confesse) to prooue, that faith can neuer faile, which may deny Christ, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and constantly as <hi>Peters</hi> did, without defect. The best is,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7863:306"/> that by their owne confession this place can proue, the acts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Romane faith to be no better, then S. <hi>Peters</hi> was in this deniall of Christ. His offence, they grant, was foule, but his faith without defect. So may Popes be monstrously luxurious in their liues, but alwaies infallible in their Doctrine. Reader, consult with thine owne heart, and giue sentence (as in the sight of God) of the whole frame of their Religion, by the foundation; and of the foundation (such as they willingly acknowledge faith to be of all true Religion and euerie Christian vertue) by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. If <hi>Peter</hi> became (as they pretend) the fundamentall rocke, by confessing: that Religion doubtles, which hath no better ground of infallibilitie, then <hi>Peters</hi> faith not secured from a threefold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of Christ, our Confession, was first planted by the Spirit of error, and of Antichrist.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Not to dispute any longer, what it was, but who they were Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was to strengthen: all without exceptions. This iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may seeme impossible, seeing the exercise of his Ministerie could not extend to all Nations, much lesse vnto all ages. Yet these wordes bequeath no hereditarie royall iurisdiction ouer all persons, but rather inioyne personall acts of penetencie vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> for his former personall offence. He had found extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie mercie at his Lord and Masters hands; and was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the like vnto his fellow seruants more guiltie of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.

Not such as by conuersion might become his brethren, or rather his children in Christ; but rather such, as were hewen out of the sameroke, and could truly call <hi>Abraham</hi> their father, <hi>Sara</hi> their Mother, ioinct professors with him of <hi>Moses</hi> Law and the Prophets, more then his brethren and associates, in denying him, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets bare testimonie.</p>

                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:7863:329"/> there is small hope of raising any new tribute from the Angels, and Saints in heauen, to the Romish churches vse; and as little feare that Christ should take any secular commodity from it, which aunciently it hath enioyed.</p>

But though it were true, that we were absolutely bound to obey an absolute Monarchie, of whose right none doubts: yet may we examine whether euery Potentate that challengeth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall iurisdiction ouer others, or giues forth such insolent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts in ciuill matters, as the Pope doth in spirituall, do not goe beyond his authority in these particulars; albeit his lawfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues in respect of others, be without controuersie many and great, yet limited both for number and magnitude. For suppose King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, after hee had done what he could against the Pope, should still haue professed his good liking of Romish religion, opposing only this to all his Popish Cleargie, that had challenged him of reuolt: <hi>Am not I defender of the faith.</hi> The Pope, whom I trow you take for no false Prophet, hath giuen me this prerogatiue amongst Christian Princes, as expresly, as euer Saint <hi>Peter</hi> bequeathed him his supremacy aboue other Bishops. It is as impossible for me to defend, as for his Holinesse to teach, any other besides the true Catholique faith. Let the proudest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst my Prelates examine my expositions of his decrees, and by S. <hi>George,</hi> he shall fry a fagot for an heretick, Would this or the like pretence (though countenanced by royall authority) haue been accepted for a iust defence, that this boisterous King had not contradicted the Pope, but the tatling Monkes, or other priuate expositors of his decrees? would this haue satisfied the Popes agents, vntill the King and his Holinesse had come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall conference, for finall debatement of the case? yet for Christs seruants thus to neglect their masters cause, is no sinne in the Romanists iudgement, yea an heresie is it not to deale so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in it. For a sinne of no lower ranke they make it, not to submit our hearts, minds, and affections, vnto the Popes nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue decrees, though against that sence of scripture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and experience giue vs. Vnto all the doubts, feares, or scruples these can minister, it must suffice; That the Pope sayth he expounds scripture no otherwise then Christ would, were hee in earth, but onely controls all priuate glosses or expositors of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7863:329"/> them. But can any Christian heart content it selfe with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, and defer all examinations of doctrine, vntill that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day come vpon him, wherein the great Shepheard shal plead his owne cause, face to face, with this pretended Vicar and his associates? Do we beleeue that Christ hath giuen vs a written law, that he shall come to be our Iudge, and call vs to a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt wherein we haue transgressed or kept it; yet may we not try by examination, whether these Romish guides lead vs aright or awry? Whether some better or clearer exposition may not be hoped for, then the Pope or Councell, for the present, tenders to vs? What if the Pope should prohibite all disputations about this point in hand, [whether obeying him against the true sence of scripture, (as we are perswaded) wee yeeld greater obedience vnto him, then vnto Scriptures;] may we not examine the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this decree, or his exposition of that Scripture which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely he would pretend for this authority, <hi>his amplius, fili mi, ne requiras?</hi> No: by their generall tenent, and<note n="*" place="margin">

For all of vs know, the man of sinne must be no open, or outward enemy to the Church, but <hi>Iudas</hi> like, a disciple by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: his doctrine, indeed, must bee a doctrine of diuels, yet counterfeiting the voice of Angels; as he himselfe, though by internall disposition of minde a slaue to all manner of filthinesse, and impurity, must bee enstiled <hi>sanctifsimus Dominus,</hi> the most holy Lord. If the poison of his iniquity were not wrapt vp in the titles of diuine mysteries, it would forth-with be disliked by many silly superstitious soules, which daily suck their bane from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perswaded that the scriptures, which they neuer haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, whose true sence they neuer tasted, but from some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of heathenish zeale, idolatrously worship in grosse, do ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant it.

That he, and his followers should in words much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods word, written or vnwritten, we do not maruell; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the higher esteeme men make of it, the higher still hee may exalt his throne, being absolutely enabled, by this deuise, to make all that belongs to God, his Word, his Lawes, his Sacraments, the pretious Body and Bloud of his Sonne, blessed for euer, meere foot-stooles to his ambition. For, if the authority of Scriptures, or such traditions as he pretends, be established as diuine, and he admitted, sole, absolute, infallible Iudge of their meaning; it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7863:330"/> would argue either Antichristian blindnesse not to see, or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of no meaner stocke, not to acknowledge that the Pope by this meane might appropriate vnto himselfe the honour due vnto God, and play vpon his Creator in such sort, as if a corrupt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer hauing euidences committed to his trust, should by vertue of them take vp rents, and let leases to the Landlords dammage, and Tennants ouerthrow. And (what is most villanous) vnto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer prerogatiues, though most preiudiciall to the diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty; his Parasiticall Canonists shall blasphemously entitle this most holy Father the sonne of God, and his faithfullest seruants, (Apostles or Prophets) must be brought forth to abette the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, as if euidence giuen in Court by infamous Knights of the Post, should in the finall day of hearing bee produced, vnder the hands and seales of free Barons, or other chiefe Peeres of the Land: for, as was intimated before, whatsoeuer the Pope though in his owne cause, shal say, it must by this doctrine, be supposed, that Christ doth say the same. Yea, if it should please his Holines to auouch <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that these words, <hi>Thou art a Priest for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after the order of Melchisedech,</hi> are truely and literally meant of himselfe as Christs Vicar, or of perpetuall succession in <hi>Peters</hi> chaire: the euidence must be taken as vpon the Almighties oath; who in that place hath sworne as much as these words import; but what that is the Pope must iudge. That then he permits Christ the title of his soueraigne Lord, and vrges others to subscribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his lawes as most diuine, is iust, as if some Polititian should so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the whole body of a kingdome, solemnely to acknowledge one, otherwise lawfull heire vnto the Crowne, for their Monarch most omnipotent and absolute, (whose will once signified must bee a law for euer inuiolable, to all his subiects) not with intent that hee should in person retaine such perpetuall soueraignety o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, but that hee might haue absolute power to dispose of his kingdome, as he pleased vnto the worlds end; or to nominate others, as absolute in his place, whilest he spent his dayes as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourner in a forraine land. Finally, not the most treacherous and detestable plot, the most wicked Pope that hath beene, is or shall be, could desire to effect, but may by this deuice be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, with as great and sacred authority, as were the best actions

Could hee not be content to pretend Christs name, or succession from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> (as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> might hee haue obtained what hee desired, would haue done) for his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage? Could hee not vrge the authority of Gods word to confirme his owne ouer it, and all that is called Gods? If in such a case it might not be permitted men to examine his allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of Scriptures, how could the diuell himselfe bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by Scriptures, or deposed from his supremacy, thence pretended? And can wee doubt, whether hee which makes no other plea, then the Diuell were hee in place might, is not that <hi>Filius Diaboli, The great Antichrist?</hi> Were we not taught that the sonnes of this world are wise onely in their owne generation, wee might iustly wonder that any men indued with naturall wit, could be so blind, as at the first sight not to descrie the politique sophismes vsed by the Romanist to cosen Christ of his kingdom. As their whole Religion is but the image of the old Romane po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; so their maine plot of <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini, the Church, the Church,</hi> as if all were rebels against Christ, that will not sweare absolute fealty to the Church Romish, may bee most fully paralelled by the like practise of such cunning States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as hauing alwaies one eye to the aduancement of their own priuate fortunes, liue vnder an absolute Monarch, of himselfe royally minded, but not much intermedling in the affairs of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test moment. Oportunity of high place vnder a king, vpon what occasion soeuer thus sequestred, that poore mens complaints cannot possesse his eares, tempts polititians to effect their owne purposes, vnder pretence of his right, to condemne all of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or disloyalty, that will not obey their designes directed in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7863:331"/> their Soueraignes name, though most abhorrent from the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his royall heart, were hee acquainted with such lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table grieuances of his poore Subiects, as are the vsuall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of Princes gracious fauours vpon great ones. The more absolute such a Princes lawfull authority, the greater his natiue subiects loue vnto him is, the more both, may both bee abused by such vnthankefull officers. As it is the soueraigne conceit all men haue of Christs kingdome, which keepes the silly in such seruility vnto the Pope, his pretended agent.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 This is the onely difference in these two cases otherwise most like. An earthly Prince may liue and die deluded of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauillian states-men, ouer whom hee hath no power, after he himselfe is once subiect. But Christ liues and raignes a King for euer; and though his throne bee in the highest heauens, beholds the things are done on earth; hee sees, and yet suffereth his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended officers to retaine such as loue darkenes more then light, in grossest ignorance and blind subiection to the Prince of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and his associate, the Prince of darkenesse; hee sees and yet suffers them detain all such as delight in lies more then in truth, from acquaintance with his holy spirit; Hee sees, and yet suffers their foulest villanies to be countenanced by his sacred lawes; hee sees, and yet suffers his holy name to be abused, to the establishing of Antichristian heresies; hee sees and yet suffers his glory made a stale for maintenance of their secular pompe. Hee is the keeper of <hi>Israel,</hi> and cannot so slumber, as any abuse shoulde escape his notice; his indignation shall not sleepe for euer, but in due time he will rouse himselfe as a Lion awaked, to take vengeance vpon all the workers of iniquity, on them aboue others, who haue thus vsurped his throne on earth, taking that iudgement during the time of his supposed absence wholly into their handes, which belongs onely vnto him: Euen so come Lord Iesu, holy and true, and with the breath of thy mouth destroy him that hath destroyed trueth and sincerity from amongst the sonnes of men.</p>

The end of the Sabaoth was to sanctifie themselues vnto the Lord; to set forth his praise both in words and workes. Such workes then onely are here onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden as did distract the mind, or make men vnapt to heare, read, or meditate on heauenly matters; all workes of secular vocation, or priuate consequence, which might hinder mens endeauours for procuring the health, or wel-fare of others; not works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or present necessity, not works tending to greater publike good, or to the auoidance of greater harmes, which could not be preuented but by present working; for men are to read, heare, and meditate vpon Gods word, that by it they may bee fruitfull in good deeds, by which Gods name is more immediately glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, then onely by speaking well, and not doing so.

The reason of this their resolution (contained in the 40 verse) was most strong, drawne from the end of the Sabaoth; <hi>For they said one to another, If wee all doe as our brethren haue done, and fight not against the heathen for our liues and for our Lawes, then shall they incontinently destroy vs out of the earth.</hi> And if the whole Iewish nation had beene at that time vtterly rooted out; who should either haue sanctified Gods Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baothes, or preserued his lawes from the iniurie of times, or fury of the heathen?

Suppose then God had said [Thou shalt obey the Priest in all things whatsoeuer he shall command thee:] a Wise man notwithstanding all this would thus resolue; suppose the Priest command mee to doe that, in doing which I shall diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, or to omit that continually, in performing of which I should obey God: am I bound to obey him in all such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: so should I frustrate the end of the law, and commit the same offence by this my blind obedience, which others doe by presumptuous and willfull disobedience vnto spirituall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. But it will bee replyed, who shall iudge whether the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gouernour commaund thee such seruice, as argues disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto God, or no? If the case bee doubtfull, and I be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by my lawfull Pastor, I haue answered already in what sense obedience must bee performed.

Shall that then bee euident which euery man shall say is euident vnto him? No, but what in deed and conscience is, and so shall appeare in his iudgement that searcheth the heart and reines. Such as do not feare his censure will make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of disobeying men, pretending authority from him: Such as with feare and trembling expect the sonne of mans appearance will not much esteeme, how they bee iudged by men further then in reason they may be perswaded, their sentence shall bee ratified in the last day of iudgement. And because God hath endued spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gouernours with power of retaining and remitting sinnes; euery one that feares him which gaue, will feare to disobey them to whom this power is giuen; lest if they retaine, hee will not remit; and retaine they iustly may, or rather must, the sinnes of all sinnes, as adde thirst to drunkennesse, contempt of Gods messengers, summons to repentance vnto actuall breaches of his

If he say no, must I not belieue him? must I not obey him, and doe as hee doth, whom the Pope commands mee to obey in all things? The Iesuites are not so simple in the Popes cause, as they would make all other in Gods: they could tell how to limit such commands, though deliuered in most vniuersall and ample termes. This is the matter then which so vexeth their deuoute hearts, and sets them beside themselues with furious zeale in this argument; that any Christian should be as wary and circumspect, lest hee should proue disloyall vnto the Creator and Redeemer of mankind, as they are, lest they should disobey the aduancer and supporter of their order.</p>

As when our Apostle commands seruants and children to obey the one, their masters; the other, their parents in all thinges: the meaning is; as if hee had said, yee that are christian seruants, be ye most willing to yeeld all obedience that is due vnto masters; yee that are Christian children, to yeeld all obedience vnto your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which is conuenient for any children to yeelde to theirs: So that the vniuersall note doth rather inioine a totality of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse and cheerefulnesse, a perfection of sincerity, in performing that obedience which other children ought to their fathers, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to their masters, then any way extend the obiect of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian childrens or seruants obedience to more particulars, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were bound vnto, at the least hee doth not extend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of their obedience to any particulars which might preiudice the sincerity of their obedience due vnto other commanders; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest hee enioyneth seruants to obey their masters in all things, he reserues their allegiance intire vnto. Princes and higher powers.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7863:339"/> Such must bee obeyed both by masters and seruants, by fathers and sonnes. Much more doth God when hee inioynes obedience in most ample forme vnto Kings or spirituall gouernors, reserue obedience due to himselfe most intire and absolute.</p>

Wherfore as the oath of Allegeance vnto Princes doth restraine the former precepts; <hi>Seruants obey your Masters in all things,</hi> that is, in all things that are not repugnant to publike lawes, nor preiudiciall to the Crowne and dignity of your Soueraigne: so must that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow of fidelity made vnto Christ in Baptisme, and our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledgement of him for our Soueraigne Lord, restraine all precepts in ioyning performance of obedience to any power on earth, and set these immoueable bounds and limits to them; <hi>Obey thy King and Gouernour in all things, that is, in all things that are not repugnant to the lawes and ordinances of the Great King, thy supreame Lord and Gouernour.</hi> Whilest thou obeyest him, thou doest well, in disobeying them, as well as that seruant that takes Armes against his Master in the Kings defence, whilest thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyest him, all other obedience is rebellion; <hi>Yee are bought with a price</hi> (saith our Apostle) <hi>bee not yee the seruants of men;</hi> Seruice according to the flesh hee elsewhere approues, he strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inioynes: for that is freedome in respect of this seruitude of minde and conscience, in being wholly at any other mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                        <p n="19">19 Nor is it more difficult for Christs seruants to discern when gouernours sollicite them to disloyalty against him, then for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants according to the flesh, to know when their masters seduce them vnto rebellion; so Christian men would feare God, as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7863:339"/> much as naturall men doe earthly Princes. Such as feare God, are sure of a better expositor of his lawes for fundamental points then seruants can haue for their Princes. The transgression of both are easie to discern in the beginning of reuolts or apostasies; but the latter more difficult, when traitors or vsurpers are grown strong, and can pretend faire titles vnto soueraigneties, or coine false pedegrees, yet is it not impossible for sober and obseruant spirits in such a case, to foresee what party to follow; vnto such the signes of the time, and carriage of the seuerall causes will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray who haue the true title. But this difficulty is none in our spirituall obedience, challenged by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for that Church in words confesseth Christ to be the true King and supreame Lord, no vsurper, which is as much as to say, the Pope is an vsurper, and a rebell, that dares in deeds and substance cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the soueraignety from him (as you heard in the former dispute, by making claime to this vnlimited, vnreserued obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Nor doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other, beside the base parasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Canonists, or the Popes trencher chaplaines, deny, but that in many ciuill causes, the Prince or temporall Magistrate hath a definitiue sentence; can hee then gather out of any circumstance of this place, that onely spirituall causes are here meant? nay, hee confesseth that the law is generall concerning all doubtes that might arise out of the law; yea it is most probable, that it onely concernes ciuill controuersies, and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reason to proue, that it includeth spirituall causes, or matters of religion, is most i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. The occasion of this Law (saith hee) was for them that did serue other Gods as appeares, out of the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; now the seruice of other Gods is a point of Religion. But what though <hi>Moses</hi> in the former part of this Chapter speake of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, must this law therefore concerne Idolaters. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part hee speaketh onely of Idolaters, but this law is not onely for them by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confession. Yea the circumstances of the place, and the expresse law against Idolaters mentioned before, euince, that in this Chapter, as in the former, he first sets downe lawes concerning the true seruice of God, and in the lattet part giues precepts for the obseruation of the second Table, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of loue, by the finall composition of all controuersies that might arise betwixt neighbours. In the former law Idolaters are sentenced to death, and Idolatry (saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) is a point of Religion; Was the Priest alone then to giue sentence, and the ciuill Magistrate onely to execute it. There is not the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for it out of this Text. Any ordinary Magistrate might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute him that was lawfully conuicted of this crime, nor was it so hard a matter to iudge, who was an Idolater amongst the Iewes, as it is to determine what is an heresie amongst the Romanists. This was to be proued by witnesses, not by Logicall proofe or force of speculatiue reason: Had the cunningest Iesuite in the world been taken amongst them kneeling down before an Image
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7863:341"/> and praying to it, all the distinctions in the master of sentences, or <hi>Aquinas</hi> or both their Commentators could not haue redeemed him, against two honest men that would haue sworne hee would haue done thus much; there had beene no appeale from any City in <hi>Iudah,</hi> vnto any higher Court; his doome had been read in the gates, and without them hee should (as <hi>Homer</hi> speakes) haue put on a stony coat.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> were only to execute the Priests defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue sentence in all hard controuersies, is a positiō wel deseruing execution without appeale at Princes hands. And no doubt but it did so amongst the Iewes. The former Court as is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was to cease, when they had a King amongst them. And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in the former Chapter, after he had giuen the other law for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding controuersies, giues the law for the election of their king, if so bee they would haue one: as if the former Court had then ceased to bee the supreme Tribunall; seeing all Subiects might appeale vnto the King from it, in which this Soueraignty did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reside, as being the supreme Tribunall, whence there could be no appeale.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The King in the Law concerning his qualification, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to haue the Law of his God written out.<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <p n="5">5 It may perhaps here be obiected, that the King had no such assurance of infallibility in iudgement as the Priest had, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was requisite he should rely vpon the Priestes definitiue sentence.

For when God saith; <hi>A diuine sentence shall bee in the lips of Kings;</hi> this speech doth no more argue a perpetuall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety in giuing righteous sentence, then if he had said; A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or erroneous sentence shall not be in the lips of Kings, or his mouth shal not transgresse in iudgement. For as that which God saith, shall not be done, oftimes is done: so may that which God saith, shall bee done, bee oftimes left vndone, Who is hee then would make this collection: God saith, <hi>Thou shalt not steale,</hi> that is no man shall steale, <hi>ergo</hi> there can be no theeues, no theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet is our aduersaries collection as foolish, <hi>The Priests lips shall preserue knowledge, Ergo</hi> they cannot erre in giuing definitiue sentence, or againe, <hi>The spirit shall lead you into all truth, they shall be all taught of God;</hi> therefore the Church shall be infallibly taught by the spirite, and shall as infallibly teach others, liue they as they list.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 These places shew what should bee done, and what God for his part will infallibly performe (so men would be obedient to his word) but neither doe these, or any of like nature, include any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of not erring without performance of due obedience in practise of life; nor doe they necessarily conclude, that men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes shall performe such obedience.

The Conclusion hence arising is; all the places that can bee brought, either for the King or Priests au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, rather shew what manner of men they should be both in life and iudgement, then assure them of any infallibility of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they be dissolute in life. This was a point neuer dreamt of by any, before the Popes notoriously infamous liues, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite the titles of sanctity and infallibility (which from a conceit of their predecessors integrity they haue vsurped) and inforced their parasites to frame a distinction of sanctity in doctrine sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from sanctity in life.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 It is questionable, whether both Priestes and Princes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> had not an extraordinary priuiledge aboue all other nations, both for being infallible in their definitiue sentences whilest they liued according to the lawes which God had giuen them, and also for their more then ordinary possibility of liuing according to such lawes. Gods blessings (as is most probable) in both these respects, were extraordinary vnto their Princes and Priests: yet not so infinitely extraordinary, that either of them might without presumptuous blasphemy hope for ordinary integrity (such as the more ciuill sort of heathens had) much lesse for any absolute infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, if they were extraordinarily wicked in their liues, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull in their other dealings. Euen the peoples wickednesse did impaire the force and vertue of these extraordinary blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to their Kings and Priests, God gaue them priests as well as Princes in his anger, such as should be plyable to their humor, not such as should infallibly direct them against the suggestions of the world and flesh for their spirituall good. So that these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises both for their spirituall and temporall gouernors
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7863:342"/> sincerity in iudgement, did depend in part vpon the condition of this peoples life.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 His second fortresse is, that neither our Sauiour Christ, nor his Apostles did euer taxe the <hi>Prelates,</hi> or inferiour <hi>Priests,</hi> by these names directly, but alwayes vnder the name of Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, lest they might thereby seeme to reprehend the <hi>Priesthood</hi> or <hi>seat of authority.</hi> And this they did, that men might know, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence to bee due vnto the <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Priesthaod,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Prelates</hi> in their liues and persons were not so commendable. The consequence is not amisse; albeit his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son bee not so firme, and the corollary, which hee hence deduceth, most malitious. Hence (saith hee) <hi>wee are giuen to vnderstand, that the heretikes of this age, which vpon euery occasion inueigh against Bishops, Priests, especially the Pope, doe but ill consent in manners with our Sauiour and his Apostles.</hi> But did neither our Sauiour Christ, nor his Apostles taxe the <hi>Priests</hi> &amp; <hi>Prelates</hi> by their proper names for that reason which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings?<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bellarmines</hi> idle and malitious collections out of our Sauiours words refuted.</note> Wee may suppose I trust without offence, that Gods Prophets did not go beyond their commission, in taxing the chiefe offences or offendors of their times; that our Sauiour or his Apostles might vpon the like or greater occasions, haue vsed the same forme of reprehension the Prophets did, or other more personall. The true reason why so they did not, was, because they had no such respect of persons or titles, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dreames of, but aimed chiefly at the fairest, for such vsually gaue greatest countenance to foulest sins. And who knowes not, how in the Synagogues latter dayes, the glorious titles of Scribes and Pharises had, in a sort drowned the names of Priests; as the reputation of Iesuites hath of late yeeres much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed all other titles of inferiour ministers, heretofore more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church? It was likewise the high esteeme of these two Saint-like sects, which seduced most silly soules throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Iewry,</hi> to follow traditions contrary to Gods lawes, as the Iesuites late fame hath drawne most of the blind Churches chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7863:345"/> (which goe more by eare then eye sight) to account villany piety, and falshood subtlety. As our Sauiour and his Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the <hi>Rabbies</hi> or Priestes in their times, not vnder the names of <hi>Priestes</hi> and <hi>Leuites,</hi> but vnder the glorious names of Scribes and Pharisies, then reputed the onely guides of godlinesse: so would they, were they now on earth (as wee in imitation of them) taxe the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy, especially vnder the names of Iesuits, or other more famous orders in that church. But the Sect of Scribes and Pharises being not knowne in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi> time, nor any other order so glorious then, as the order of Priests,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mala.</hi> 2.1.</note> he tels them their owne in their proper names; <hi>And now O yee Priests this commandement is for you.</hi> So did <hi>Micah</hi> and <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and euery <hi>Prophet,</hi> as their demerites gaue occasion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 His third fortresse is, that whatsoeuer Christ saith of <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, must he conceiued to make more for Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> and such as sate therin. Why our Sauiours admonition should make more for the Popes authority within his owne territories then it did for the Scribes and Pharises, or High Priests authority in the land of Iewry; I see no reason that it may concerne the people, liuing vnder the Pope, and Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> as much as it did the people of <hi>Iewry</hi> then subiect to the High Priest, Scribes and Pharises, I will not deny; for such Iudges as they were, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> in their seuerall generations may bee, nay, would God they were not. Let vs see then, what infallibility in giuing definitiue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can proue out of the fore-mentioned place. The words are plaine, <hi>Whatsoeuer they bid you doe, that doe.</hi> What, all without any exception? nay, you doe the Papists wrong, if you collect so; <hi>Whatsoeuer they speake ex Cathedra.</hi> Then the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though most vniuersall for the forme is restrained by our aduersaries themselues, vnto such doctrines onely, as they taught <hi>ex Cathedra.</hi> And iustly, seeing this restraint hath more apparent ground in the Text then any other. Therefore it is said, <hi>they sit in Moses seat,</hi> they are infallible, not alwaies, because they somtimes fit; but whiles <hi>they sit in Moses seat,</hi> or giue sentence out of it; what is it then to giue sentence out of <hi>Moses</hi> seat? to pronounce sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence solemnly, and vpon deliberation? If vnto all their doctrines or definitiue sentences so pronounced, men had beene bound in conscience to yeeld obedience: the Pope (as shall bee shewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none) had neuer sate in <hi>Peters chaire;</hi> yea, <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe had been
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7863:345"/> in conscience bound to be an <hi>Apostata</hi> from Christ.<note place="margin">

But God who ruled the month of <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> and made him speake the trueth, when hee intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse, did also direct <hi>Canus</hi> penne to vent, what vpon better consideration hee would haue concealed. Yet herein hee wrote, but out of the abundance of his owne, and most of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7863:349"/> hearts, who hold that the Priests and Pharises did erre one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a matter of fact, not in any point of faith, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Christ. Of which in the next Chapter. For conclusion of this, consider with me, Christian Reader, how great cause we haue to thanke our gracious God, that the sect of Iesuites, or rabble of Predicants, were not founded in our Sauiours dayes; for then doubtlesse the Diuell had picked a traitor out of that crue, whose impudent, sophisticall Apologies for open blasphemie, and vnrelenting perseuerance in traiterous plots, might haue outfaced the world, that the deliuering of Christ into his enemies hands had beene no such sinne as <hi>Iudas</hi> testified it was, both by his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent speech, and desperate end.</p>

If the Romanist should say, that they had no such infallible authority in deciding all controuersies, as their Church now challengeth: the assertion would be as improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it selfe, as incongruous to their positions. For vnto any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man such infallibility in the Watch-Tower of <hi>Sion,</hi> must needes seem more requisite during the time of the law, then since the promulgation of the Gospell. Bee it granted, the points to be expresly beleeued of the ancient people, were but few: yet euen such of them as were most necessary to saluation, were more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatically and mystically set downe, then any in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament are; and the measure of Gods spirit vpon euery sort of men, (the vulgar especially) in those times, much lesse. For this cause God raised vp Prophets to instruct them, whose authority

                           <hi>Iosephus</hi> records, the chiefe argument vsed by <hi>Zidkiah</hi> to diminish <hi>Micaiahs</hi> credite with both Kings, was an appearance of contradiction betwixt his and <hi>Eliahs</hi> prediction of <hi>Ahabs</hi> death, the accomplishment of both being apprehended as impossible, lesse credit (as he vrged) was to be giuen to <hi>Micaiah,</hi> because so impudent as openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict so great a Prophet of the Lord as <hi>Elias,</hi> at whose threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> trembled, humbling himselfe with

And it is likely hee would so short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after entertaine the professed seruants of <hi>Baal</hi> for his Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors? yet, seeing the euent hath openly condemned them for seducers, and none are left to plead their cause: it is an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Iesuite or others to say, they were <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets by profession.

Hee is more blind then the blindest Iew that euer breathed, who cannot see how such as professed themselues Priests and Prophets of the Lord, aswell in <hi>Iudah</hi> as in <hi>Israel,</hi> did bewitch the people with the selfe same spels the Papists boasts of to this day, as the best prop of his Catholike faith. Yet such is the hypocrisie of these proud Pharises, that they can say in their hearts; <hi>Oh had wee liued in the dayes of Iezabel, we would not haue beene her inquisitors against such Prophets as Elias and Micaiah were:</hi> When as in truth <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> impietie towards them, was clemency in respect of Romish cruelty against Gods Saints, her witchcrafts but as veniall sins, if wee compare them with Iesuiticall sorceries.

Then this following, better cannot be imagined on their behalfe, [That this supreme authority which they contend for, was in the true Prophets onely; that they, albeit inspired with diuine illuminations, and endued with such authority as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite makes the Popes <hi>humana diuinitas inspirata,</hi> did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing permit their declarations, for the hardnesse of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heart to be tried by the euent, or examined by the law, not that they wanted lawfull power (would they haue stood vpon

And no doubt, but the people did well in admitting the true Prophets doctrine, before the false, at the first proposal; the sooner, the better. But were they therefore to belieue the true Prophets absolutely without examination? Why should they then belieue one of that profession, before another, seeing sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers could propose their conceits with as great speed and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torinesse as the best?

Euen in businesses of greatest importance, though requiring spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest expedition, a wise man will moderate his pace according to the quality of the ground whereon hee goes, otherwise the more haste may cause worse speed.

Much more vsually did prophesies during the standing of the first tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, spring out of Mosaicall predictions. If wee compare his writings with latter prophesies, not long before the Babylonish captiuity, though hee had departed this life before their fathers entred into the land of promise, yet hee speakes vnto this last generation as an intelligencer from a farre Country, that great preparation was made against them, but who should bee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners or managers of mischiefe intended; hee leaues that to such Prophets as the Lord should raise them vp for the present. <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> vpon his admonition following his direction, are sent by God, as it were, to scowre the coast, to discrie when the Nauy comes, for what Coast it is bound, and how neare at hand. Here had the people faithfully examined their hearts by <hi>Moses</hi> law, whether not guilty of such sinnes as deserued the plagues threatned by him, they had quickly assented vnto <hi>Moses</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and the Prophets words. For as consciousnesse of their sinnes in generall, might cause them feare some plague or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, indefinitely threatned by their Lawgiuer, whose writings they best belieued: so might the diligent obseruation of their particular transgressions, and their progresse in them, haue taught them to presage the determinate manner of their plagues and punishments foretold by the present Prophet. For God in his vsuall course of iustice, so suites his punishments to the most accustomary habits or predominant sinnes, as vnto men religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously obseruant of times and seasons, the growth and processe of the one will giue a certaine crisis of the other. Besides euery age hath peculiar signes subordinate to the generall predictions of good or euill foretold by Gods messengers, whereby the faithfull learne to know the day of their visitation, and as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>to hide themselues (in latibulo altissimi) from the plague;)</hi> if not by their hearty repentance, godly prayers, and religious endeauors

And because wee in this age, are not so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the particular signes of former times, wherein true Prophets liued, it is hard for any liuing now, though easie to all the faithfull then, to giue any certaine or particular rule how the truth of their prophesies might haue beene, at least probably knowne, before the euent did finally and absolutely approue them. Would to God wee could discerne the signes of times present; and the Lord of his infinit mercy giue vs grace to know the day of our visitation. But of this argument elsewhere by Gods assistance.

That which most condemned the Iewes of infidelity, in not acknowledging Christ as sent with power full &amp; absolute from God his father, were his mightie signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, his admirable skill in Gods word alreadie established; but chiefly his sacred life and conuersation, as it were exhibiting vnto the world a visible patterne or cōspicuous modell of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible goodnesse which is infallible. Now, if we compare his powerfulnesse in words and workes, with the Popes imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in both; or his diuine vertues with the others monstrous vices: to equalize their infallibities, were to imagine God to bee like man, and Christ (at the best) but as his faithfull seruant; the Pope his Minion, his Darling, or some of his age. For such is our partialitie to our owne flesh, that oftimes (though the Wise man aduise to the contrarie) a lewde and naughtie sonne (in that hee is a sonne) hath greater grace and priuiledges, then the most faithfull seruant in the fathers house.

Here a wise man, that (as the wise King speakes) had eyes in his head and would not be led by a blind faith, would haue paused a while, and thought with himselfe, This is a point that should bee looked to: for if these new doctrines should proue incompatible, as for any iust examination hitherto made, they may, I cannot see whether deserues more credence; Whiles I consider <hi>Moses</hi> writings, &amp; call to mind those mighty wonders our fathers told vs, with like

But if vpon iust trial they shal be found fully to agree in euery point (as I trust they doe) then doubtlesse both are from God, and I shall stedfastly belieue this new doctrine to be diuine, if such as <hi>Moses</hi> had foretold, &amp; withal, more euidently acknowledge, then before I could, that <hi>Moses</hi> spake by the spirit of the all seeing, euerliuing God, if this <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> be in all points like to him, and so qualified as hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the great Prophet should bee.

The most deuoutly superstitious or idolatrous might (at the least) more then probably haue gathered, that the God of <hi>Moses</hi> was greater then any, they or rheir cunning Magitians worshiped. But it is a curiosity incidēt to superstitious hypocrites, at their first entrāce into Gods schole, scrupulously to demand full satisfaction in all doubtes or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can be suggested, and (as if they sought to obtaine mercy by way of bargaine, not by faith or fauour) to haue their assurance precisely drawne, and fully sealed, before they surrender vp the least part of their interest, in any pleasure, commoditie, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome long enioyed, though neuer so destitute of reason. As in this case, imagine some Romish Schooleman or Iesuite had been in such fauour in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, as that crew is now in too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes; what other collections could wee imagine he would haue made, but these?

For though Diuels sometimes suffer themselues to be commanded by men, neither of greatest wisdome, best place, nor fashion: yet this they doe (as any well instructed in Gods law, or illuminated with the notions of good and euill will easily discerne) alwayes with purpose to bring men vnto a perpetual acknowledgement of som diuine power in them, or to performance of some Magicall seruice vnto them; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then cheating mates or cunning gamesters can be well content to suffer bunglers beate them the first or second set, in hope to entise them holde play longer, or for greater wagers. On the contrary, the onely fee our Sauiour demanded for all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable cures in this kind, was, the parties should giue such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto God alone, as that infernal crew most detested, but which the law of <hi>Moses</hi> so highly esteemed by his calumniators, did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely require in defiance of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and all the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The end of euery particular dispossession was such, and the multitude of legall confessions, sincerely vttered by poore soules set free, so many as his bitterest aduersaries owne consciences, could not but witnesse against themselues, that all the chiefe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Satans wonted triumphes ouer Gods people, were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Besides, few or no instances could (I thinke) bee brought of Diuels cast out in any Magitians name, in Christs they were, and (as it seemes) by such as had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquaintance, or more alliance with his accusers, then with himselfe.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7863:382"/> a counterfeit. So did not euery prediction of what afterwardes came to passe, necessarily argue it to haue beene from God. Yet as the force and vertue of many things, not such of themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came euident from vicinity, or irriation of their contraries: so though God permitted some to foretell strange euents for triall of his peoples faith; yet this power hee restrained when the controuersie came to a former triall; then hee caused the true Prophets words to stand, whiles the predictions of the false, and the Princes bloud which relied vpon them, fell to the ground l ke <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke. So as the fulfilling of what the one, and frustrating of what the other had said, did sufficiently manifest the one had spoken of himselfe presumptuously; the other, what the Lord had put into his mouth.

This is an argument, which directly confutes such, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Christ to haue been a Prophet, sincere in doctrine; &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in deedes: and yet denie him to be the Prince of that professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the great mediator of the new Couenant, both which hee often auouched.

                        <p n="2">2. You will say perchance they did not well in giuing so little attention and credite to the Prophets, whose light should haue led them vnto Christ: but now that they haue light on him in person, without their helpe, onely by his seeking them, shall not hee who was the end and scope of all propheticall writings, teach them all? He will: but not by relying onely vpon his infallible authoritie. This <hi>aedifice</hi> of faith must bee framed vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laide by the Prophets. For this reason happily our Sauiour would not bewray himselfe to be their infallible teacher, vntill he had made them by euidence of Scripture, by true sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his spirit, beleeue and knowe the truth, which he taught, to be infallible. Hee had opened their hearts, by opening the Scriptures vnto them before their eyes were open to discerne his person: for<note n="b" place="margin">

Would the Pope who challengeth Christs place on earth amongst his liuing members, and requires we should beleeue his wordes, as well as these Disciples did Christs, but expound those Scriptures vnto vs which Christ did to them, with like euidence and efficacie; could hee make our hearts thus <hi>burne</hi> within, by opening the secret mysteries of our saluation: wee would take him for Christs Vicar, and beleeue indeede hee were infallibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the holy spirit.

For if you would drawe a line from the Zenith to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir through the Center, it would scarce be a gag long enough for this monstrous mouth; so wide as hell cannot conceiue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The depth I gather, partly from the excesse of Christs worth, either arising from his personall vnion with the Godhead; his sanctitie of life and conuersation; or from his hyperpropheticall spirit and aboundant miracles. For looke how much he exceedes any but meere man in al these: by so much doth the Pope (though supposed as not obnoxious to any crime) make his authoritie and fauour with God greater then Christs, which is the semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this mouth of blasphemies. The other part, equall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in quantitie, but for the qualitie more tainted with the dregges of Hell, ariseth from that opposition the Popes spirit hath vnto Christ; or from the luxury and beastly manners of the Papacie, erected by Satan as it were of purpose to pollute the world with monstrous sinnes, and to derogate as much from mankinde, as true Christianitie doth aduance it: finally to make the Christian world as much more wicked, as Christs Disciples; Apostles, and faithfull followers are better then the heathen.

What heathen Philosopher could with patience haue endured to heare, that a dissolute luxurious tyrāt could not, though in matters of this life, giue wrong sentence out of the seate of Iustice?

Vnto this obseruation the Reader may adde other like descriptions of this scarlet Whore; all so fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeing to the Papacy, as hee that will not acknowledge it for the Kingdome of great Antichrist, hath great reason to suspect his heart, that if hee had liued with our Sauiour, he would scarce

If any man thus doubt, whether the Pope be Antichrist, so hee doe not approue his hatred and warre against Gods Saints, or his other diuelish practises: Gods peace bee vpon him; and in good time I trust his eyes shall bee enlightned to see the truth in this particular, as those two Disciples did in the Article of the resurrection.</p>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7863:400"/> though the spectators might beleeue the particular conclusions: to whose confirmation the miracles were fitted, yet was it not safe, without examination, absolutely to rely vpon him, in all thinges that had spoken a diuine truth once or twice. In that he might be an hypocrite or a dissembler, for ought others, without euidence of his vpright conuersation, and perpetuall consonance to his former Doctrine, could know, he might abuse his purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reputation to abet some dangerous errour.

Many others haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued holy and righteous, according to their measure vntill the end: but who could be certaine of this besides themselues? no not they themselues alwayes. And albeit a man that neuer was in the state of grace, may oft times deliuer that Doctrine which is infallible: yet were it (to say no worse) a grieuous tempting of God to rely vpon his Doctrine as absolutely infallible, vnlesse we know him (besides his skill or learning) to be alwayes in such a state. Though both his life and death bee most religious, his Doctrine must approue it selfe to the present age, and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence must cōmend it to posterity Nor did our Sauiour though in life immutably holy &amp; for doctrine most infallible, assume so much vnto himselfe before his ascension, as the Iesuits giue to the Pope.

                        <p n="3">3 Thus whilest this great Clerke would digge a pit for the blinde (for he could not hope (I thinke) this blocke should stumble any that hath eyes in his head) he is fallen into the middest of it himselfe: by seeking to vndermine vs, he hath smothered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and buried the cause he was to maintaine. For if without the Trent Councels testification wee cannot by diuine faith beleeue the Scriptures, or former Councels, to bee of diuine authoritie; How can such as were borne within these thirty yeares, beleeue that Councell it selfe, which ended aboue fortie yeares agoe? Few this day liuing were auditors of the Cardinals and Bishops decisions there assembled; not hearing them, their faith must needs be grounded vpon heare-sayes. Againe, if it bee true, the Scriptures cannot be knowne to be diuine, but by the authoritie of the present visible Church: if this Church doe not <hi>viua voce</hi> confirme all Christians in this fundamentall truth, their faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diuine, but humane. VVhat the Pope or his Cardinals thinke of these pointes, is more then any liuing knowes vnlesse they heare them speake, and then it may be a great question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they speake as they thinke. Pope <hi>Alexander the sixts</hi> decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should haue beene negatiue, like the fooles boult in the Psalme, <hi>There is no God, No Christ, No Gospell,</hi> for so his meaning might haue beene interpreted, as they say dreames are, by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, seeing hee neuer spake as hee thought.

Sufferance hereof was in his iudgment no lesse preiudiciall to the State Ecclesiastique, then vnto the temporall it would be, to permit malefactors trauerse the equitie of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique lawes established and knowne, after sufficient proofe or confession made of Capitall offences committed against them.

For no Iesuite I thinke, will say these Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had the Popes sentence <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> to assure them before hand what Councels had beene lawfully called, and fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; or whether all the ancient Canons they afterwardes reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished were alreadie as authentique and certaine as they could be made: For so it had beene a labour altogether lost, yea a matter no lesse prophane then rebaptization, to haue confirmed them by suffrages of Bishops, after their Cathedrall confirmation by the Pope. Euen of his Holinesse himselfe, whose verdict (as in this case must finally be supposed) addes diuine credence vnto testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in their owne nature fallible and merely humane, the question proposed in the former Section remaines still insoluble. For without the relation of some Historian, or Register, or espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reuelation from aboue, no Pope can diuine how many Councels haue beene held, much lesse what was finally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in euery ancient Canon confirmed by the Bishops assembled at Trent. Speciall reuelations, such as the Prophets had, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge none. And yet distinctly to tell what hath been done in times past, or places a farre off, without relying on others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, is an extraordinarie effect of speciall reuelation, a worke of higher nature and greater difficultie, then Propheticall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things to come. Are then the relations of Historians, or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7863:403"/> Registers of Ancient Councels diuine and authentique. Not without the Popes ratification: with it they are? Yes, or else a great part of Roman faith by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reason can bee but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Hence may we safely annex a corollary, as necessary, as sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the maine conclusion proposed, for the principal subiect of this section. [As the Popes authority is, by Iesuitical Doctrine made much greater then our Sauiours, so may the assistance or countenance of his omnipotent spirit, make the reports of any tē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing Historian, or mercenary Register, as diuine, authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que and certaine, as any Propheticall or Apostolicall testimonies of the Messiah.] Yea, if it should please him to authorize <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Annals, or relations of former Councels, their credit should be no lesse than the Euangelists. Yea hence it followes, (as the discreet Reader, without further repetition of what hath here beene said, or new suggestion of the reasons whereon the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is grounded, will (I hope) of his owne accord<note n="a" place="margin">Cha. 6. parag. 5.

In the one, the most generall or remotest cause; In the other, the most immediate or next cause alwayes terminates the resolution. The one imitates, the other inuerts, the order of composition; so as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7863:410"/> what is first in the one, is last in the other, because that which is first intended, or resolued vpon by him, that casteth the plotte, is best effected by the executioner or manuall composer. In the former sense, wee say mixt bodies are lastly resolued into their first Elements; houses into stones, timber and other ingredients; particular truthes into generall maximes: conclusions into their <hi>immediate</hi> praemises; all absurdities into some breach of the rule of contradiction. Consonantly to this interpretation of <hi>finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;</hi> the <hi>first verity, or diuine infallibility,</hi> is that into which all faith is lastly resolued. For (as wee saide before) this is the first steppe in the progresse of true beliefe, the lowest foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereon any Religion, Christian, Iewish, Mahometan, or Ethnicke can be built. And it is an vndoubted Axiome, <hi>quod primum est ingeneratione, est vltimum in resolutione; when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue any thing into the parts whereof it is compounded, we end, in the vndoing or vnfolding it, where nature begunne in the composition or making of it.</hi> But he that would attempt to compose it againe, or frame the like aright, wold terminate all his thoghts or purposes by the end or vse▪ which is farthest from actuall accomplishment. Thus the Architect frames stones and timber, and layes the first foundation according to the platforme he carries in his head; &amp; that hee casts proportionably to the most commodious or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant habitation: which, though last effected, determines all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations or resolutions precedent. Hence, if wee take this <hi>vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima resolutio,</hi> as we alwayes take these termes, when we resolue our owne perswasions, that is, [for a resolution of all doubts or demands, concerning the subiect whereof wee treat] A Roman Catholiques faith must, according to his Principles, finally bee resolued into the Churches infallibility. For this is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ground, or first cause of any particular or determinate point of Christian faith, and the immediate cause is alwayes that, into which our perswasions concerning the effect is finally resolued, seeing it onely can fully satisfie all demandes, doubts or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it. As for example, if you aske why men, or other terrestriall Creatures, breath, when fishes doe not: to say they haue lungs, and fishes none, doth not fully satisfie all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds or doubts concerning this Subiect. For it may iustly further be demanded, what necessity there was the one should

If here it bee answered, that men and other perfect terrestiall creatures, are so full of feruent bloud, that without a cooler their owne heate would quickly choake them, and in this regard, the God of nature who did not make them <gap reason="foreign">

For no man of sense would further question, why life should be preserued, whose preseruation immediately depends vpon respiration, or exercise of the lungs, &amp; is therfore the immediate cause of both, and that whereunto all our perswasions; concerning the former subiect, are lastly resolued. Or, if it should bee demanded, why onely man of all other creatures hath power to laugh; to say, he were indued with reason, doth not resolue vs; for a Philosophical wit would further question, <hi>[Why should reasonable substances haue this foolish faculty rather then others?]</hi> A good<note n="*" place="margin">Laurentin. de Risu.</note> Philosopher would perswade vs the spirites which serue for instruments to the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall part, are more nimble &amp; subtle, and so more apt to produce this motion, then the spirites of any other creatures are. But this I must professe resolues not me: for how nimble or subtle soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, vnlesse man had other corporeall Organes for this motion, the spirits alone could not produce it: and all organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call parts are framed for the operation or exercise of the faculty, as their proper end. Whence, hee that would finally resolue the former probleme, must assigne the true finall cause why reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable substances, more then others, should stand in need of this motion. Now seeing vnto reason onely it is proper to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast danger, and procure sorrow and contristation of heart by preconceit of what yet is not, but perhaps may bee: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that our mortality through <hi>reason</hi> obnoxious to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, should bee able to correct this contristant motion by the contrary, and haue a faculty to conceiue such pleasant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects as might dilatate the heart and spirites; that as man hurts his body by conceited sorrow, whereto no other Creature is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, so he might heale it againe by a kind of pleasance, whereof bee alone is capable.</p>

                        <p n="6">6 This obiection, had some late Logicians vnderstood what they said, would carry some shew of truth to countenance <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> former circular resolutiō, but they lace their M<seg rend="sup">rs.</seg> rule, vttered by him <hi>Pingni Minerua,</hi> too too straightly.

Whose misconstructiō not impeched might in some sort shroud the Romanists sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnes in this Argument.</note> of circular demōstrations, the conceit wherof can haue no place but in a giddy braine. To demonstrate the finall cause in any worke of Nature, were to assigne a Counsailor to the infinite wisdome of the God of Nature; in whose intention the end is first, and is the cause of all operation or efficiency. Who could giue, or who would demaund a naturall cause why life should be prescribed? for this is the will of him that gaue it. If question were made of the manner how the life of man and other creatures is preserued, when as their heat might seeme to choake them? A man might truly answere, by respiration: and respirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7863:412"/> is from the lungs. But it is one thing to aske how or by what meanes, another, for what end any effect is produced. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an inquiry of the efficient, within those precincts of meanes or motions alwayes prime and independent; The later of the final cause absolutely, indemonstrable, becauses it implies a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to giue a reason why that should be, for whose sake all other things of that ranke haue being. Nor is the end it selfe (to speake properly) euer produced, though oftimes in common speech, we take the effect immediately thereto destinated (because most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) for the end it selfe, as we doe the starre next to the pole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause visible, for the pole or point immoueable. Thus we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found respirations or actuall preseruation of life with the finall cause why men haue lungs; when as both are effects of the lungs, both meanes of accomplishing Natures or rather the God of Naturs purpose, in whose will or pleasure the finall cause of any naturall effect alwayes consists. And seeing nothing in Nature can preoccupate his will, no cause can be precedent to the finall. This consideration of natural effects tending as certainly to their proposed end, as the arrowe flyes to the marke, caused the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious<note n="*" place="margin">Aueroes.</note> Philosopher to acknowledge the direction of an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent supernaturall agent in their working, the accomplishment of whose will and pleasure (as I said) must bee the finall cause of their motions; as his will or pleasure which bestowes the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not the Architect (vnlesse he be the owner also) is the finall cause why the house is built. Finally, euery end supposeth the last intention of an intelligent agent, whereof to giue a reason by the efficient which onely produceth works or meanes thereto proportioned, would be as impertinent, as if to one demaunding why the bell rings out, it should bee answered, because a strong fellow puls the rope.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Now that which in our aduersaries Doctrine answeres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cause indemonstrable whereinto finall resolution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures workes or intentions of intelligent agents must be resolued,<note place="margin">Faith cannot be resolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any definite branch of the <hi>First Truth.</hi>
                           </note> is the churches authoritie. Nor can that, if wee speake properly, be resolued into any branch of the first truth; for this reason (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sids others alleadged before) that all resolutions, whether of our perswasiōs or intentions, or of their obiects (works of Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) suppose a stability or certainty in the first links of the chaine
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7863:413"/> which wee vnfolde; the latter alwayes depending on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, not the former on the latter. As in resolutions of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kinde lately mentioned (imitating the order of compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) actuall continuation of life depends on breathing▪ not brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on it: breathing on the lunges, not the lunges mutually on breathing: so in resolutions of the other kind (which invertes the order of composition) the vse or necessitie of lunges dependes vpon the vse or necessitie of breathing; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or vse of breathing vpon the necessity or vse of life, or vpon his will or pleasure that created one of these for another. Thus againe, the sensitiue facultie depends vpon the vital, that vpon mixtion, mixtion vpon the Elements, not any of these mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vpon the sensitiue faculty; if wee respect the order of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance or Natures progresse in their production. Whence hee that questions whether some kinds of plants haue sense, or some stones or mettals life, supposeth as vnquestionable, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer haue life, that the second are mixt bodies. But if we respect the intent or purpose of him that sets nature a working; all the former faculties dpend on the sensitiue, the sensitiue not on any of them. For God would not haue his creatures indued with sense, that they might liue; or liue, that they might haue mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: but rather to haue such bodies that they might liue, to liue that they might enioy the benefit of sense, or the more noble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 Can the Iesuite thus assigne any determinate branch of the first truth, as stable and vnquestionable, before it be ratified by the Churches authoritie? Euident it is, by his positions, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; and as euident, that beliefe of the churches authority cannot depend vpon any determinate branch of the first truth, much lesse can it distinctly be thereinto resolued. But contrariwise, presse him with what Diuine precept soeuer, written or vnwritten, though in all mens iudgements (the churches authoritie set aside) most contradictory to their approoued practises: for example, [That the second Commaundement forbids worshipping I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or adoration of the consecrate host;] he straight inuerts your reason thus, Rather the second commandement forbids ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because the holy Church, which I beleeue to bee infallible, approueth both.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7863:413"/> for true, which the Church disproues, nothing for false or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, which it allowes. Or, if he would answere directly to this demaund, [To what end did God cause the Scriptures to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?] He could not <hi>(consonant to his tenents)</hi> say [That wee might infallibly rely vpon them,] but rather [vpon the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie which it establisheth.] For Gods word whether written or vnwritten,<note place="margin">Vide annot. cap. 15. Sect 3. paragr. 2.</note> is by their Doctrine, but as the testimonie of some men deceased, indefinitely presumed for infallible, but whose materiall extent the Church must first determine, and after wards iudge, without all appeale, of their true meaning. Thus are all parts of Diuine truthes, supposed to be reuealed, more essentially subordinate to the Churches authoritie, then ordinary witnesses are to royall or supreme iudgment. For they are supposed able to deliuer what they know, <hi>in termes intelligible</hi> to other mens capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, without the Prince or Iudges ratification of their sayings, or expositions of their meanings; and iudgment is not ordained for producing witnesses; but production of witnesses, for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing iudgement. Thus by our aduersaries Doctrine, Gods word must serue to establish the Churches authority: not the Churches authority, to confirme the immediate soueraigntie of it ouer our soules.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 Much more probably might the Iew or Turke resolue his faith vnto the first truth, then the moderne Iesuited Papist can. For though their deductions from it be much what alike, all ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually sottish: yet these admit a stabilitie or certainty of what the first Truth hath said, no way dependant vpon their authority that first proposed or commended it vnto them. The Turkes would storme to heare any Mufti professe he were as well to be beleeued as was Mahomet in his life time; that without his proposall they could not know eyther the olde testament or the Alcoran to bee from God. So would the Iewes if one of their Rabbines should make the like comparison betwxit himselfe and <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite doth betwixt Christ and the Pope: who, besides that hee must bee as well beleeued as his Master, leaues the authority of both testaments vncertaine to vs, vnlesse confirmed by his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. But to speake properly, the pretended deriuation of all three heresies from the first truth, hath a liuely resemblance of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7863:414"/> false petigrees, none at all of true doctrine and resolutions. Of all the three the Romish is most ridiculous, as may appeare by their seuerall representations. As, imagine there should be three Competitors for the Romane Empire; all pleading it were to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by inheritance, not by election; all pretending lineall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. The first, like to the Iew, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth an authentique petigree, making him the eldest. The second, resembling the Turke, replyes, that the other indeede was of the eldest line, but long since disinherited, often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and enforced to resigne; whence the inheritance descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him as the next in succession. The third, like the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, pleades it was bequeathed him by the Emperours last wil and testament, from whose death his Ancestors haue beene intitled to it, and produceth a petigree to this purpose, without any other confirmation then his owne authority; adding withal, that vnlesse his competitors and others will beleeue his recordes and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (written or vnwritten) to be most authentique, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certaine whether euer there had beene such an Emperour as they plead succession from, or at least how farre his Dominions extended, or where they lay. This manner of plea in secular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, would be a meane to defeate him that made it. For albeit the Christian World did acknowledge there had beene such an Emperour, and that many parts of Europe of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto his lawfull heire: Yet if it were otherwise vnknowne what parts these were, or who this heire should bee; no Iudge would be so mad as finally to determine of eyther vpon such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. Or if the Plaintiffe could by such courses as the World knowes oft preuaile in iudgement, or other gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, effect his purpose: hee were worse then madde that could thinke the finall resolution of his right were into the Emperours last will and testament, which by his owne confession, no man knowes besides himselfe; and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into his owne presumed fidelitie, or the Iudges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant partialitie. So in this controuersie whatsoeuer the Pope may pretend from Christ, all in the end comes to his owne authority; which wee may safely beleeue, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to bee most infallible, that it will neuer prooue partiall
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7863:414"/> against it selfe, or define ought to his Holinesse disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                           <hi>Bellarmine,) that wee know there bee some bookes diuine, which questionlesse cannot by any meanes be knowne by Scriptures. For albeit the Scripture say, that the Books of the Prophets or Apostles are diuine: yet this I shall not certainely belieue, vnlesse I first belieue that Scripture, which saith thus, is diuine. For so wee may read euery where in Mahomets Alcoran, that the Alcoran it selfe was sent from heauen; but wee belieue it not. Therefore this necessary point [that some Scripture is diuine,] cannot sufficiently be gathered out of Scriptures alone. Consequently, seeing faith must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon Gods word; vnlesse wee haue Gods word vnwritten, we can haue no faith.</hi> His meaning is, wee cannot know the Scriptures to be diuine, but by Traditions; and what Traditions are diuine, what not, wee cannot know, but by the present visible Church: as was expresly taught by the same Author before.

                           <hi>Sacroboscus</hi> thus farre accords: Some Catholiques reiected diuers Canonicall Books without any danger, and if they had wanted the Churches proposall for others, as well as them, they might without sinne haue doubted of the whole Canon.

                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus collects: <hi>It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary not onely to bee able to read Scriptures, but to vnderstand them: but the Scripture is often so ambiguous and intricate, that it cannot bee vnderstood, without the exposition of some that cannot erre: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it alone is not sufficient. Examples there be many. For the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the diuine persons, the Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, as from one ioint originall, Originall sinne, Christes descension into Hell, nd many like, may indeed be deduced out of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but not so plainely as to end controuersies with contentious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, if we should produce onely testimonies of Scriptures. And wee
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7863:416"/> are to note there bee two things in Scripture, the Characters or the written words, and the sense included in them. The Character is as the sheath, but the sense is the very sword of the spirite. Of the first of these two all are partakers; for whosoeuer knowes the Character, may reade the Scripture: but of the sense all men are not capable, nor can wee in many places bee certaine of it, vnlesse Tradition be assistant.</hi> It is an offer worth the taking that here he makes, <hi>That the sense of Scriptures is the sword of the spirit.</hi> This is as much as wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that the sense of the Scripture is the Scripture. Whence the inference is immediately necessary, That if the Romish Church binde vs to belieue, or absolutely practise, ought contrary to the true sense and meaning of Scriptures, with the like deuotion we doe Gods expresse, vndoubted commandements: she preferres her owne authority aboue Gods word, and makes vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that allegiance vnto her which we owe vnto the spirit. For suppose wee had as yet no full assurance of the spirit, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory sense to that giuen by the Church: we were in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty to expect Gods prouidence, and inuoke the spirits as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance for manifestation of the truth; from all possibility wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee desperately exclude our selues, if wee belieue one mans testimony of the spirit, as absolutely &amp; irreuocably, as we would do the manifest immediate testimony of the spirit: yet<note n="*" place="margin">Quod caput religionis maius aut celebrius est; quam mysterium sanctissimae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis; quae triū personarum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struitur diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas? hoc tamen tam par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7863:416"/> or from it first entrance into our hearts, vntill our departure out of this world. How farre, and in what sort the Ministery of men in the Church is auaileable, for planting faith, hath been declared heretofore. Eyther for the planting or supporting it, the skill or authority of the teachers reaches no further, then to quicken or strengthen our internal taste or apprehension of the diuine truth reuealed in Scriptures; or to raise or tune our spirites, as Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke did <hi>Elishahs,</hi> the better to perceiue the efficacy of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, imprinting the stampe of those diuine Reuelations in our hearts, whose Characters are in our braines.

How essentially faith by our aduersaries doctrine dependes vpon the churches authority, is euident out of the former discourses: that this dependance is perpetuall, is as manifest, in that they make it the iudge and rule of faith, such an indefectible rule, and so au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique a Iudge, as in all points must be followed, and may not be so far examined, eyther by Gods written law,<note place="margin">The principall difficulties in the Romists o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, wherto no sufficient answere can be giuen.</note> or rules of nature, whether it contradict not it selfe or them.</p>

The visible Church (saith the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite) is able, to discerne all diuine truth by her infallible publique spirit. How knowes he this certainly, without an infallible pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique spirit? perhaps as men see Cats-eyes shine in the darke, when their owne doe not. Let him beleeue so.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7863:422"/> of the Churches authoritie depriues vs of all true and stedfast beleefe concerning Gods Word or any matter contained in it. God (as they plead) hath reuealed his will obscurely: and vnto a distinct or cleare apprehension of what is obscurely reuealed, the visible Churches declaration is no lesse necessary, then light to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of colours. The reason is one in both, and is this. As the actuall visibilitie of colours wholly depends vpon the light, as well for existence, as duration: so, by Iesuiticall Doctrine, <hi>true beleefe</hi> of Scriptures wholly depends on the visible churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as well during the whole continuance, as the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it. By the same reason, as we gather that light in it selfe is more visible then colours, seeing by it alone colours become actually visible: so will it necessarily follow, that the churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration (that is, the Popes priuiledge for not erring) is more stedfastly to be beleeued, as more credible in it selfe, then eyther the Canon of Scriptures or any thing therein contayned: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these become actually credible vnto vs onely by the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches declaration, which cannot possibly ought auaile for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, vnlesse it were better beleeued.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Perhaps the Reader will here challenge mee, that this last instance proues not al that I proposed in the title of this chapter. For it onely proues the Popes supremacie is better to bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; then that Christ is come in the flesh; that God did euer speake to men in former ages by his Prophets, and in later by his sonne. But this inferres no absolute alienation of our beleefe from Christ, seeing euen in this respect that wee beleeue the Church or Pope so wel, we must needs beleeue that Christ is come in the flesh and that God hath spoken to vs sundrie wayes: for thus much the Pope auoucheth. Yea, but what if the church teach vs that Christ is our Lord and Redeemer, and yet vrge vs to doe that which is contumelious to his Maiestie? What if it teach vs that these Scriptures are Gods Word: and yet binde vs by her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible decrees to breake his Lawes, and giue his spirit the lie? Should we make profession of beleeuing as the Pope teacheth, and yet take his meaning to be onely such as <hi>Marnixius,</hi> whom we better beleeue, would make it: His Holinesse would quickly pronounce vs Apostataes from the Catholike faith.

For what glory could the allurement of silly ignorant men to simple ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry be vnto great Antichrist? Let them first subscribe to the written Lawes of the euerliuing God, and afterwardes wholly submit themselues to his determinations for their practise, and so the opposition betwixt him and the Deity, betwixt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions and the decrees of the Almighty, may bee more posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, more directly contrary. The Heathen or others not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Gods word at all, are rightly tearmed vnbeleeuers: men thus beleeuing the Scriptures in generall to be Gods word, from the testimony of the Church, and yet absolutely relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her iudgement for the meaning of particular places, are transported from vnbeliefe to misbeliefe, from grosse ignorance to wilfull defiance of God &amp; his lawes. Finally, they are brought to know Gods word, that they may doubt in this and like feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Like their first parents they heare Gods sentence, but preferre the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Sathans first borne before their owne, because it must bee presumed hee is more subtle then they. Or to referre the two maine streames of this iniquity to their proper heads: The first, [That we cannot know the olde or new Testament to be Gods word, but by relying vpon the Church] makes all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers to it, reall Atheists or Infidels, and Christians onely in conceit or vpon condition, [If the Church, whose authority they so highly esteeme, be as infallible as is pretended.] Heretofore I haue much grieued at the Trent Councels impiety: but now I wonder at these graue Fathers folly, that would trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with prescribing so many Canons, or ouerseeing so large a Catechisme, when as the beginning of <hi>Protogoras</hi> booke, one or two words altered, might haue comprehended the entire confession of such mens faith, as rely vpon their fatherhoods, The Atheist thus beganne his booke; <hi>De dijs non habeo quod dicam, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum sint necne: Concerning the Gods or their being, I can say nothing.</hi> A priuate Romane Catholike might render an entire account of his faith in termes as briefe: <hi>De Christo &amp; Christiana fide non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo quod dicam, vtrum sint necne: Whether there bee a Christ, or Christian Religion bee but a politike fable, I haue nothing to say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily, yea, or no, the Church or Councell can determine:</hi> whom in this, and all other points wherein God is a party, I will abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely belieue, whilest I liue: if at my death I finde they teach amisse, let the diuell and they (if there be a diuell) decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7863:424"/> with infernall spirits, whose chiefest solace consists in acting greatest villanies, or wresting the meaning of Gods writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lawes to his dishonour. For iust proofe of which imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee are to preuent what (as wee late intimated) might in fauour of their opinion bee replyed to our former instance of light and colours.<note place="margin">An obiection which might bee made in fauour of the Romanists, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</note>

                        <p n="9">9 Some perhaps, well affected, would be resolued, why, as hee that sees colours by the sunne, sees not onely the sunne but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours with it, so hee that belieues the Scriptures by relying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church, should not belieue the Church onely, but the Scriptures too, commended by it. The doubt could hardly bee resolued, if according to our aduersaries tenent, the Churches declarations did confirme our faith by illustrating the Canon of Scriptures, or making particular truthes contained in it, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently more perspicuous: as if they were in themselues but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially credible, and made actually such by the Churches te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, which is the first and <hi>principall credible;</hi> in such sort as colours become actually visible, by illumination of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and prime visible. But herein the grounds of Romish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and the instance brought by <hi>Sacroboscus,</hi> to illustrate it, are quite contrary. For the light of the Sunne, though most necessary vnto sight, is yet necessary onely in respect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, or for making colours actually visible; which, made such, or sufficiently illuminated, are instantly perceiued without further intermediation of any other light then the internall light of the Organe, in discerning colours alwaies rather hindred then hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by circumfusion of light externall. For this reason it is, that men in a pitte or caue may at noone day see the starres, which are inuisible to such as are in the open aire: not, that they are more illuminated to the one, then the other; but because plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of light doth hinder the organ or eye-sight of the one. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all obiects, eyther actually visible in themselues, or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently illuminated, are better perceiued in darkenesse then in the light. But so our aduersaries will not grant, that after the church hath sufficiently proposed the whole Canon to be Gods word, the distinct meaning of euery part is more cleare and facile to all priuate spirits, by how much they lesse participate of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Churches further illustration. For (quite contrary to the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7863:425"/> former instance) the Churches testimony or declaration is onely necessary, or auaileable to right beliefe, in respect not of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to be beleeued <hi>[Scriptures;]</hi> but of the party beleeuing. For (as hath beene obserued) no man in their iudgement can belieue Gods word, or the right meaning of it, but by beleeuing the Church: and all beliefe is inherent in the belieuer. Yea this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted beliefe of the Churches authority,<note place="margin">Vide Sect. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; Sect. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                           </note> is that, which in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and <hi>Sacroboscus</hi> iudgement, makes a Roman Catholicks beleefe of Scriptures, or diuine truthes taught by them, much better then a Protestants. If otherwise the churches declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or testimony, could without the beliefe of it infallibility, which is inherent in the subiect belieuing, make Scriptures cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, as the light doth colours visible in themselues: a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant that knew their churches meaning, might as truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them as a Romane Catholike, albeit hee did not absolutely belieue the church, but onely vse her helpe, for their Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall interpretation, as hee doth ordinary expositors, or as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe the benefite of the Sunne for seeing colours, which neuer thinke whether colours may bee seene without it or no. For though it bee certaine that they cannot, yet this opinion is meerely accidentall to their sight: and if a man should be so wilfull as to maintaine the contrary, it would argue onely blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mind, none of his bodily sight. Nor should distrust of the Romish churches authority, ought diminish our beliefe of any diuine truth, were her declarations requisite in respect of the obiect to bee beleeued, not in respect of the subiect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 Hence ariseth that difference which plainely resolues the former doubt. For seeing the Sunne makes colours actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible, by adding vertue or lustre to them: wee may rightly say, wee see colours, as truely as the light, by which wee see them. For though, without the benefite of it, they cannot be seene: yet are they not seene by seeing it, or by relying vpon it testimony of them. Againe, because the vse of light is onelie necessary in respect of the obiect, or for presenting colours to the eye; after once they bee sufficiently illuminated or presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, euery creature endued with sight, can immediately discern each from other, without any further helpe or benefite of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7863:425"/> light, than the generall, whereby they become all alike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually visible at the same instant. The Sunnes light then is the true cause, why colours are seene: but no cause of our distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing one from another beeing seene, or made actually visible by it. For of all sensible obiects sufficiently proposed, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue faculty, though seated in a priuate person, is the sole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate supreme Iudge, and relies not vpon any others more publike verdite of them. On the contrary, because the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists supposed firme beliefe of Scriptures, or their true meaning, ariseth onely from his vndoubted beliefe of the churches veracity which is in the belieuer as in it subiect, not from any increase of inherent credibility, or perspicuity thence propagated to the Scriptures: Hence it is that consequently to his positions, most repugnant to all truth, hee thinkes, after the church hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently auouched the Scriptures diuine truth in generall, wee cannot infallibly distinguish the true sense and meaning of one place from another, but must herein also rely vpon the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches testimony; and onely belieue that sense to bee repugnant, that consonant to the analogie of faith, which shee shall tender, albeit our priuate consciences bee neuer so well informed by other Scriptures to the contrary. The truth then of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conclusion is hence easily manifested. For seeing they hold both the Scriptures and their distinct sense to bee obscure and vnable to ascertaine themselues, vnlesse the Church adde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity or facility of communicating their meaning to priuate spirits: such, after the Churches proposall, cannot possibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them any better, or more directly in themselues, then they did before, but must wholy rely vpon their Prelates, as if these were the onely watchmen in the Tower of Gods church, that could by vertue of their place discerne all diuine truth. Others must belieue there is an omnipotent God, which hath giuen his law; a Mediator of the new Testament: but what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either of Law or Gospell is, they may not presume other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to determine, then weake sights do of things they see con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly a farre off, whose particular distance or difference they must take onely vpon other mens report, that haue seene them distinctly, and at hand.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 To illustrate these deductions with the former similitude
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7863:426"/> of the <hi>prime</hi> and secondary <hi>visibles.</hi> Let vs suppose for disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sake, that the Sunne which illuminates colours by its light, were further indued (as wee are) with sense and reason, able to iudge of all the differences betweene them, which it can manifest to vs, and hence challenge to bee a Pope or infallible proposer of colours. This supposition the Canonist hath made lesse improbable. For <hi>Deus fecit duo luminaria, God made two lights,</hi> that is, by his interpretation, the Pope and the Emperour. Or, if you please to mitigate the harshnesse of it, let the Man in the Moone, whom we may not imagine speechlesse, bee suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the sunne or Pope of colours, <hi>Mercurie</hi> or <hi>Nuncio.</hi> As the Papists say, wee cannot know Scriptures to be Scriptures, but by the infallible proposall of the Church: so it is euident wee cannot see any colour at all, vnlesse illuminated or proposed by the Sunnes light. But after by it wee see them, suppose wee should take vpon vs to discourse of their nature, or determine of their distinct properties as now wee doe, and the sunne or Pope of colours, by himselfe or his Nuncio should take vs vp, as Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi> did the blinde man restored to sight, which hee neuer had lost; Yea? who taught you to distinguish colours? were you not quite blinde but now? as yet you cannot discerne any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours without my publike light, and yet will you presume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their properties, and distinguish their natures against my definitiue sentence knowne? Must not hee that enables you to see them, enable you to distinguish them seene? Must you not wholly rely vpon my authority; whether this bee white, or that blacke? If a man vpon these Motiues should absolutely belieue the sunnes determinations, renouncing the iudgement of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate senses: could hee truely say, that hee eyther knew this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to be white or that blacke, or another greene? Rather were he not bound to say, I neither know white from black, nor blacke from blew, nor blew from greene: but I know that to be white which the Sunne, the onely infallible Iudge of colours, saith is white; that onely to bee blacke, that blew, and that greene which he shall determine so to be. I may thinke indeed that the snow is white, or coales blacke: but with submission to the Sunnes determination.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 And yet, as you haue heard at large out of the Trent
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7863:426"/> Councell, and best Apologies can bee made for it, the Church must bee the infallible Iudge of all Scripture sense, and must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely be belieued without all appeale to scriptures, not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally as shee shall accord with them. The conclusion hence issuing, is most infallible, and on their parts most ineuitable: <hi>[Whosoeuer absolutely acknowledgeth this authority in the Church or Consistory, &amp; yelds such obedience vnto it in all determinations, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Canon of Scriptures, doth not belieue eyther this or that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate proposition of faith, or any definite meaning of Gods word.</hi> The best resolution hee can make of his faith is this; <hi>[I belieue that to bee the meaning of euery place, which the Church shall define to bee the meaning:]</hi> which is all one, as if hee had said, I doe not belieue the Scriptures or their meaning, but I belieue the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and sentence concerning them.

But if when the Pope shall teach the doctrine of Diuels, men absolutely belieue it to be Christs, because his pretended Vicar commends it to them: in thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, they commit such preposterous Idolatry, as those of <hi>Calecut,</hi> which adore the Deuill, vpon conceit, doubtlesse, of some celestiall or diuine power in him; as the absolute Papist doth not adore the Pope, but vpon perswasion he is Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, and teaches as Christ would doe, <hi>viua voce,</hi> were hee again on earth.

No brat of hell, but would seeme as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to their eyes, as young todes are to their dammes, if their mother once commend the feature of it, or acknowledge it for her darling. Did not some of the Powder plotte, after Gods powerfull hand had ouertaken them, and sentence of death had passed vpon them, euen when the Executioner was ready to do his last office to them, make a question whether their plot were sinnefull or no?

For if it bee true (as it is most true) that faith cannot vtterly perish from off the earth; what damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuse of Gods mercy and fauour toward mankind is this, in seeking, as the Iesuites doe, to make all absolutely rely vpon one in matters of faith?

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7863:429"/> in this point, did they not as farre exceede their father in impudency, as they come short of him in wit.

For seeing (as I saide) God hath promised, that true faith shall not perish from off the earth; for all men to aduenture their faith vpon one mans infallibility, who may haue lesse sauing faith in him then Turke or Infidell, is but a prouoking or daring of God to recall his promise.

                        <p n="4">4 But to proceede. As the doctrine is most impious, so are the grounds of it most improbable. For how can the Pope or Papists infallibly know this or that man to bee a Saint; Seeing there is no particular reuelation made of it, eyther to the Pope or others? <hi>I answere</hi> (saith <hi>Valentian) that the generall reuelation, whereby it is euident, that whatsoeuer the Pope shall decree, as pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the whole Church, is most true, may suffice in this case.

                           </note> Again, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope in defining a controuersie vse diligence or no, yet without all question hee shall define infallibly, and consequently vse the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Christ hath giuen him. Wherefore in his iudgement, care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence are necessary to the Pope, not so as if hee could not define aright, or rightly vse his authority without them: but that hee doe not sinne himselfe, whilest hee defines an infallible truth for others to belieue. Hereto may bee added, that albeit a diligent care were necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the infallibility of the Popes decisions; yet the same faith, which binds vs to belieue he decides the controuersie infallibly, binds vs
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7863:430"/> also to belieue that hee vsed as much diligence as was requisite. As for example, in like case, If God should promise that the next yeere should be a plentifull yeare of corne, we would conceiue he promised withall good and seasonable wether, &amp; whatsoeuer else were necessary for effecting of his promise, as</hi> Canus <hi>well notes.</hi> But <hi>Valentians</hi> last conclusion is, <hi>that no sure arguments can be brought, why wee should thinke study or diligence are necessary for the right vse of the Popes authority, so farre as it concernes other mens faith that must rely vpon it.</hi> Rely vpon it they must, whether he determine <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or vpon delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and (for ought I can see) whether hee giue his sentence drunke or sober, rauing or in his right mind, so he haue the wit to charge all vpon paine of damnation to belieue it. But what if some forreiner should of set purpose send a dead-mans water to trie this grand-Phisitions skill: could hee without either care or diligence, in examining their testimonies, or speciall reuelation from aboue (which in such businesses <hi>Valentian</hi> disclaimes) disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their knauery? Or would his prognostication of life &amp; health, redeeme the party deceased from the land of death, as some say Pope <hi>Gregory by his prayers did Traian?</hi> These and many like que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions might here bee made, which fall not within the reach of <hi>Valentians</hi> answeres hitherto recited: and yet these must abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly suffice for resolution of all doubts concerning the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of Saintes, or approbation of religious orders;<note n="*" place="margin">And yet some religious orders autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by Popes haue proued naught, but we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue their rules were good whilst one Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues them, but grew out of date and vnfitting those times wherein succeeding Popes did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull them.

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7863:437"/> vnto Hierusalem, <hi>I will bring the most wicked of the Heathen, and they shall possesse their houses:</hi> but more terrible is our doome, if this sentence be gone out against vs, <hi>I will plague you by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedst amongst the Christians,</hi> by men more cruell, proud, and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then Babylonian, Turke or Infidell, or any other enemie of Christs Church hath beene, or could be, vnlesse Christians or Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites in name or shew, they were meere Antichristians, or <hi>Barie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> in heart and affection. Such titles we readily giue, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare giuen vnto <hi>Loyolacs</hi> infamous broode. But if our wayes shall continually proue as odious vnto our God, as these termes import that <hi>Societic</hi> is vnto vs: what haue we done? Surely tyed our bodies to the stake of iustice, by the wickednesse of our hands, and proud imaginations of our polluted hearts; whiles our ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, in the meane while, haue set our cruell executioners hearts on fire, more grieuously to torment, to consume and deuour vs.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 But though likelihood of their preuailing against vs bee, without our repentance, great, and their crueltie, if they should preuaile, more then likely to be most violent: yet this their hope it cannot be long.</p>

                        <p>The Lord in due time will turne againe the captiuitie of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the now liuing may liue to see these sonnes of <hi>Babel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, as they haue long sought to serue vs. Their shamelesse Apologies for equiuocation, and this old charme of <hi>Templum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> which like vnluckie birds alwaies flocking, or frogs croaking against ill weather, they haue resumed of late with ioynt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate cryes (albeit with these they bewitch the simple, &amp; choake the worldling or carelesse liuer, that accompts all serious thought of Religion his greatest trouble) sound vnto harts setled in grace, or minds illuminated with the spirit of truth, but as the last crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Lucifers</hi> candle, sometimes shining in the Roman Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne as the morning starre, or an Angell of light, but now so farre spent and sunke within the socket, that it recouers it wonted brightnesse but by flashes; nor can his nostrils, that is able with the least breath of his displeasure from heauen in a moment to blow it out, any long time endure the smell. Euen so, O Father, for thy sonne <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> sake; euen so, O Christ, for thine Elect
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7863:438"/> and chosens sake, impose a period to our grieuous sinnes against thee, and our enemies malice against vs: infatuate their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, enfeeble their strength, and preuent them in their Deuillish purposes that seeke to preuent thee in thy iudgements, by setting the world in combustion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy comming. <hi>Amen.</hi>
